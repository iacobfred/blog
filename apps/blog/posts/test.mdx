# What it was like to grow up LDS

I grew up in a faithful LDS home. My father was raised Catholic and converted in his early 20s after
meeting the missionaries. My mother is second generation; her mother grew up Baptist and converted
as a young adult. I am the oldest of their six children; I have four younger brothers and one
younger sister.

My parents have always been active members of the church (as far as I know) and have held many
church callings over the years. They raised my siblings and me to be faithful, strong Latter-day
Saints as well. Ever since I was little, my parents taught me about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ,
Joseph Smith, etc., and they taught me the importance of praying and of reading the scriptures. We
prayed over each meal and at bedtime, and they also taught me to pray to find lost toys and things
of that nature — whatever I needed help with. One of the first two books I started reading on my own
as a little child was the Book of Mormon. (The other was Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.)

My baptism I was baptized when I was 8 years old, as were all of my siblings. My parents were very
obedient to the commandments and principles taught by the church, and they taught me to be obedient
as well. I went to church every Sunday with my family, participated in my ward's Cub Scout (and
later Boy Scout) program(s), had family prayer every night and Family Home Evening every week, etc.
In an effort to be obedient to "the spirit of the law" as well as "the letter of the law," my family
even abstained from cafeinated sodas (which, although not required as obedience to the Word of
Wisdom, could be considered a mark of dedication and discipline). Also, because my parents felt that
video games would be a negative influence and a distraction during my childhood, there were no video
games; I read lots of books instead. Overall, I grew up in a very sheltered LDS environment, and
there was never any question in my mind about whether or not I would serve as a missionary when the
time came.

In my first ward (the ward I grew up in until I was 15), the youth group was small. The young men
that were older than me were several years older than me, and the young men that were younger than
me were more than a year younger than me, so I was Deacons Quorum President and then Teachers Quorum
President. There were some more youth in other wards whom I got to know through combined stake youth
activities and after I began attending early-morning seminary as a freshman in high school.

Following my freshman year of high school, I moved to a different school and ward. Moving was
difficult because I had to leave behind my friends (some of whom I had known since 1st grade, others
of whom I had become attached to during the preceding year or two). The decision of whether or not
to move was not mine to make, though, and after having some time to adjust, I eventually came to
think of the move as a good thing.

I noticed in my new ward that there seemed to be a sort of division between cool and uncool kids,
that there were some drug-users (pot-smokers) among the young men, and that there were so many young
women. I had a pretty large group of LDS peers for the first time, and it was overall a very new and
different social dynamic. Although I was not entirely comfortable in the new social environment, I
was thankful to the individuals who reached out to me. Because of the several young men and young
women that reached out to me (and to my younger brother), it was not as hard to begin reintegrating
as I had expected. Actually, I may have even received more than my fair share of attention for a
while — mostly because I was new and partly because I played the piano well and was smart.

As an LDS youth, I wanted to live up to others' expectations of me, and I also tended to take things
seriously in general and to be highly self-motivated. I had close to perfect attendance in seminary,
was the seminary class president, memorized the scripture mastery scriptures rapidly, etc., and I
was always willing to talk about the church with my non-LDS friends at school. A few of my Indian
friends once came to early morning seminary with me when I invited them, and that was a fun
experience for me.

After I turned 16 and became a priest, I started going on dates with laurels every once in a while —
not too often, though. I was very shy, so I only dated often enough to feel that I was doing my
part. My first date was with a girl named Jennifer who was a couple years older than me; she was
very nice and had been one of the first youth to reach out to me after I moved into the ward, so I
considered her to be a friend. I cannot remember who my second date was with, but the more important
thing is that I doubled with a half-Japanese youth from my ward named Scott, who soon became my
closest friend in the ward.

In school, I moved up a grade to the class above mine because I decided to graduate a year early
from high school. Many of the most academically competitive students in the class of 2010 became
aware of me at that point because of my class rank and because I was suddenly in their classes. I
became friends or at least friendly with many of those students, and when circumstances were
favorable, I sometimes shared my LDS beliefs and experiences with them.

During the summer between my sophomore/junior and senior years of high school, I attended EFY in San
Antonio, Texas, with my friend Scott. EFY was a spiritual and enjoyable experience for me. I
struggled somewhat with self-confidence issues throughout my youth. However, I never doubted the
truth of the church. My paradigm was the same as that of many other faithful Latter-day Saints: the
church is true, the Book of Mormon is the word of God, Joseph Smith was a true prophet, God and
Jesus Christ live and are whom the church teaches Them to be, the head of the church is God's
prophet today, we will never go astray if we follow the prophet, and everything in life in some way
conforms to the truth of the church — even things that we do not completely understand.

Throughout my youth, it was always my intention to prepare to serve a mission. The Gospel was
important to me, and I knew that serving a mission was something that was expected of me and that
would be an important part of my future.

After graduating high school at 17 years old, I attended BYU (in Provo) for one year. I chose to
attend BYU because I felt at the time that BYU was the school that would best meet my three key
criteria for selecting a university:

- High quality of education
- Affordability
- A relatively good spiritual environment in which to prepare to serve a mission

While at BYU, I took the two required Book of Mormon classes, several GE courses, and, because of my
interest in the Honors Program (for which study of a foreign language is a requirement), two
semesters of Japanese. I almost took Greek to complement my high school studies of Latin, but I
decided to go with Japanese instead because of the connections I had begun to make with Japanese
culture (through my half-Japanese friend, Scott) and because it felt more right to me. I never had
any reason to regret my decision to study Japanese; I enjoyed learning Japanese, and my best friends
throughout my freshman year at BYU were from my two Japanese courses. After completing my freshman
year at BYU, I returned home to work full time and to continue preparing to serve a mission. I was
hooked up with an internship at New Breed Logistics, Inc. in Fort Worth, TX, by a family friend
within the church, so I worked there full-time for six months. During this time, I also studied the
scriptures (particularly the Book of Mormon) extensively on my own and in a mission prep course
organized by my stake patriarch.

Around this time (while I was living back at home in Texas), my younger brother (the oldest after
me) distanced himself from the church. He admitted to my parents that he did not believe the
church's truth claims and had never received spiritual satisfaction by attending church or taking
part in other LDS practices. He had felt that way for a long time. This was difficult for my
parents, especially since it came out at the same time as the revelation that he had a
cannibis-smoking habit. None of this had any effect on my own beliefs, and my relationship with my
brother remained basically unchanged. I assumed or hoped that he would "figure things out" as time
went on, and I continued to focus on preparing to serve a mission.

I enjoyed my experience working at New Breed. I got along well with my supervisors — executives
named Wendy and Tony. They were not LDS, but they knew that I was LDS, and they seemed to think of
me as an exemplary young man. Although I was in an essentially undefined position that had been
created experimentally, I demonstrated competence and initiative and was given management
responsibilities for the process that had previously been overseen directly by Wendy. The factory
operators whom I oversaw assumed that I was around 30 years old and was a college graduate, and I
decided not to clue them in that I was actually an 18-year-old high school graduate. Incidentally,
Tony was gay. I did not know at first, but I found out after a few months. Having little experience
with homosexuals up to that point, I had observed only that his behavioral mannerisms were somewhat
different; he tended to be more effeminate. When I learned that he was gay, I was not too surprised,
but I did start to wonder for the first time in my life about the welfare of the souls of gay
people. Tony was a genuinely nice guy — one of the nicest people I had ever met, actually. I could
not honestly tell myself that Tony was a sinner for being gay or for living according to his sexual
orientation (living with another man). I figured that Heavenly Father must be aware of him and his
trials and have a place for him in His plan.

While continuing to work, I began waking up early in the morning to work out at the gym with a
couple of the young men in my ward and to attend my younger brother's early morning seminary class
with him. My brother had already told my parents about his feelings about the LDS church, but he
still had to attend church and seminary as a condition of living at home. He did not get along well
with his seminary teacher (whom he considered to be a racist and a religious fanatic), so I decided
to attend with him as an observer. It was a chance to be a little closer to my brother and to make
sure that things were OK in seminary.

Eventually, I submitted my mission papers. About a week later, I was feeling a little nervous about
where I would be called — to be honest, I did not want to serve stateside, although I would
willingly have done so if that was how things turned out. I decided to express my thoughts to
Heavenly Father and to ask for some peace of mind. When I prayed, I felt comforted and encouraged,
and the thought came distinctly to my mind that I had been being "prepared for years to serve a
mission in Japan."

The next week, I received my letter from the First Presidency, and I was called to serve in the
Japan Kobe Mission. I was happy. Although it was not an enormous surprise to anyone familiar with my
situation (considering that I had taken a couple semesters of Japanese at BYU), I felt that my
experience with prayer had been validated and that the Lord was aware of me and had some sort of
plan for me as an individual.

I labored for hours over my farewell talk when the time drew near for me to leave. When I gave the
talk in Sacrament meeting, I felt the Spirit strongly as I spoke of the Atonement and shared my
testimony. I was told afterward by more than one member of the bishopric that my talk had been very
impressive and spiritually powerful, and/or that they themselves could not (at least at my age) have
given such a talk. I was surprised that the talk had turned out as well as it did (because I have a
fear of public speaking), and I was glad that I had been able to convey some of my feelings and
perhaps to strengthen or inspire some of the ward members.

I considered myself to be a real missionary as soon as I put on my name badge in the MTC, and I took
my calling as a missionary seriously. In my first email home, I wrote,

> I got my name tag right after I reported, so since then it's really felt like I'm Elder
> Fredericksen. The badge is also a reminder that I'm representing Jesus Christ…

When I met my MTC companion, Elder Greenburg, I sensed that he felt awed by his calling like I did.
He seemed to be humble and sincere, and I was glad that we were made companions. On our second day,
I was selected as the first district leader for my district (which consisted of four elders and two
sisters, all destined for Kobe); the branch presidency told me that the district leader selections
were inspired and that they were depending on me to be a stellar leader and example for my district.
On our third day, Elder Greenburg and I began teaching our first investigator, who in reality was
one of our teachers pretending to be an investigator. For both my companion and me, our first
teaching experiences were very spiritual; they were opportunities for us to use our limited Japanese
to successfully testify and to invite unto Christ.

My Japanese progressed rapidly throughout my stay in the MTC, as did my studies of Preach My Gospel
and the scriptures; other missionaries, including my companion, tended to struggle more. I often
helped my companion to study the language, and we, like all other foreign-language-speaking
missionaries, prayed multiple times each day for the gift of tongues.

Although I did not allow myself to entertain this thought at the time, I could not help but be aware
that there was no evidence at all of divine aid (the gift of tongues) in our language-learning
efforts. Missionaries did not acquire the Japanese language any more effectively than non-Mormons
would have, given similar language training and a reason to learn. Those with an aptitude for
language learning were able to acquire the Japanese language more quickly and more accurately, and
those without an aptitude for language learning consistently struggled to make progress. Believing
that the most important thing was to be faithful and diligent, I continued to pray regularly for the
gift of tongues and other gifts of the Spirit and to believe that the Lord would help his
missionaries when they really needed His help to communicate with the Japanese people.

After three weeks or so, I wrote the following of our schedule in the MTC:

> We get up at 6:30, and all of our day is scheduled. Daily Planning Session, Breakfast, Personal
> Study, Classroom Instruction, Lunch, Language Study, Classroom Instruction, Dinner, Personal
> Study, etc. The last hour of the day from 9:30 to 10:15/10:30 is labeled Personal Time but is
> referred to by our leaders at the personal revelation hour. During that last hour we are in the

> Branch meeting and leadership training are because I'm a district leader, and I organize and

> each week, so everyone has to be prepared to speak on the week's topic. In Japanese.

P-day is the one day when we do have some free time, although the day is still scheduled. P-day is
our once-a-week chance to email home, write letters, do laundry, etc. First thing in the morning on
P-day, we go to the Provo temple, so I've been able to go to the temple here 3 times so far… There's
also Tuesday Evening Devotional from 7 to 8 or so, followed by an hour long Devotion Review, which
is another meeting that district leaders are responsible for…

I initially got along really well with my MTC companion, Elder Greenburg, but I eventually became
somewhat frustrated that he was what he termed a "social butterfly." After our first couple weeks,
he began leaving our classroom frequently to go talk with elders in other rooms, etc., even though
the rule was for companions to stay within sight and sound of each other (except when using the
restroom). I wanted to be obedient and focus on the tasks at hand, and I felt that my companion was
preventing me from doing so. Unfortunately, I allowed that to take a toll on my relationship with my
companion.

Many of the elders in the other districts, whom my companion chose to be around for much of the
time, seemed to treat the MTC the same way they had treated high school or college; they played
around constantly, used nicknames, habitually made sexual innuendos and jokes, etc. Although I tried
to not be unfriendly to those elders, I considered their behavior to be inappropriate. I had
difficulty understanding how they could take their callings as missionaries so lightly. I wondered
if they did not care that Jesus Christ's name was on their chests. I wondered if they had become
missionaries just to go with the flow and without intending to truly devote themselves to their
callings, and I wondered if they would shape up once they got into the mission field.

At some point, I befriended one of the worst offenders because he began to treat me as a personal
trainer after deciding that he wanted to build more muscle. (I was pretty physically built at the
time.) Spending time working out with that elder helped me to be less judgmental of him and the
others. I realized that he and the other elders came from different LDS backgrounds than I did, and
that they were not necessarily bad people even if their behavior was often inappropriate. My
companion was stressed because of his difficulties learning Japanese, and socializing with others
was his way of coping with stress. Although I recognized this, I still wanted him to live by the
missionary rules and standards with me. I believed that the solution to his stress was to simply
work hard and rely on the Lord rather than wasting time or being disobedient. My critical attitude
toward my companion's behavior led to a couple altercations between us, unfortunately. The MTC
probably would have been overall a more satisfying and good experience for both of us if I had
consciously tried to have more empathy and love for him and to find ways to remain obedient to
missionary standards without making things unpleasant between the two of us.

Overall, the MTC was a mixed experience, and I enjoyed many parts of it. In my weekly emails home, I
always milked the good, spiritual experiences and omitted all negative experiences. I wanted my
mission to be an inspiring experience for my family and friends as well as for myself. I frequently
closed my weekly emails home by bearing my testimony:

> …I know that God loves us. I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know that Jesus Christ is our
> Savior and that he performed the Atonement so that we could repent and be forgiven of our sins and
> progress and return to our Heavenly Father. …I know that the church is true, and I know that Jesus

The MTC had been full of special experiences, and I was grateful for my time there, but I was more
than ready to move on to the mission field when our 11 weeks in the MTC were complete.

My MTC district and I woke up very early the morning of our departure and were soon on a plane from
Salt Lake City to San Francisco. From San Francisco, we flew to Osaka, Japan. I do not know what the
seating arrangements were for the rest of my MTC district, but I was seated next to a Japanese man
named Kimura. During the plane ride, I was able to introduce the church to a real Japanese person
for the first time. My Japanese must have been limited at the time, but I remember that I was able
to speak with him and that it was a satisfying experience. He was unresponsive about religion, but
he was polite to me. I wondered if he might run into missionaries again someday in Japan.
Regardless, it felt good to already be doing missionary work before even arriving in Japan.

When we arrived in Japan the next day (or the same day, due to the time difference), my first
thought after stepping off the airplane was, The air is thick. Wearing a suit in the humid summer
heat, I was soon drenched in sweat. After making it through security, customs, etc. and receiving
foreigner ID cards,

> …we were picked up by our mission president and his wife (President and Sister Zinke) and the
> assistants, and they drove us to the mission home in Kobe. They served us all a big delicious
> American-style dinner, I had several helpings of everything, and we (the elders) slept in the
> bottom floor of the honbu [headquarters] where the assistants and office elders stay. That first
> night and the next day, we were in Kobe and [received] training, etc. …on Thursday morning we
> received our new companions and assignments for our first areas…

The trainer whom I was assigned to was a 10th transfer missionary named Elder L., and I was told
that my first area would be Fukuyama in Hiroshima Prefecture. Elder L. and I left soon after that
and arrived in Fukuyama that evening.

Introducing my first area to my family, I wrote the following:

> Fukuyama is at the far western edge of the Kobe mission. It's actually the only area in the Kobe
> mission that is in Hiroshima-ken — the rest of Hiroshima-ken is in the Fukuoka mission, which
> covers Kyuushuu (the southernmost of the three main islands of Japan; I'm on the middle island)…

> things out…it is awesome to be out here doing the Lord's work.

The next week, I described my new missionary schedule:

> Up at 6:30. Exercise until 7, then breakfast and showers. From 8 until noon is study (since I'm a
> new missionary; the elongated study schedule is supposed to be followed for 12 weeks, and after
> that it's 3 hours total), which is divided into an hour each of personal study (gospel,
> scriptures, etc.), companionship study (sharing what we learned during personal study with each
> other, planning lessons for investigators, etc.), and language study. And since we're on the
> elongated study schedule, another hour of 12 Week Training Program in which we practice principles
> and fundamentals of teaching and being guided by the Spirit as we teach. Then we make lunch in the
> apartment. Then we start dendo (proselytizing), which could include housing, streeting, lessons
> with investigators, park dendo… Dendo lasts until 8 or 9, and then we make dinner back at the
> apartment, and crash on our futons at 10:30.

In some ways, missionary work was a little difficult for me to adjust to in the beginning. I really
wanted to teach the Gospel, but I didn't want to bother people, and I felt that some of our
proselytizing activities were bothersome to the Japanese people. My trainer didn't feel the same
way, and I gradually got used to contacting people on the streets. I enjoyed teaching lessons to our
investigators, although unfortunately we never had more than a couple investigators at a time. Our
most receptive, consistent investigator was Harayama-san, a very humble, older man. After meeting
with him for about a month, I wrote:

> I can see the change occurring in this man as he accepts the gospel of Jesus Christ. He has always
> been humble and thoughtful for as long as I've known him (about a month now), and he has learned
> about the nature of God as our loving Heavenly Father and about the Atonement of Christ, the
> doctrine of repentance, the restoration of the Gospel… those things change people.

Harayama-san had an interesting living situation, as I recounted around the same time:

> Harayama-san has quite a story…he's now fairly homeless here in Fukuyama and is receiving the

I enjoyed working with our investigators, but I eventually became somewhat disillusioned with my
trainer. He seemed to want me to always accept his words as authoritative truth even though he
sometimes tried to teach me things that were incorrect. I sometimes felt that Elder L. resented me
for having my own thoughts and opinions, and he tended to be condescending. Also, as my Japanese
continued to rapidly progress, I gradually realized that my trainer's Japanese was terrible and that
he was wasting his study time studying kanji (Chinese characters utilized in Japanese) rather than
learning to speak properly so that we could teach more effectively. However, that all being said, my
trainer was not a bad person or even necessarily a less-than-average-quality missionary; in
hindsight, my expectations of him seem to have been unrealistic. Although I was bothered my some of
my observations of my trainer, I tried to maintain a positive outlook and to only think (to myself)
and say (to others) positive things about him. Still, I did struggle, mostly because I did not sense
a great deal of respect and love from my trainer but rather felt resented at times.

I found out from Elder L. at some point that he had become a trainer shortly after asking President
Zinke to make him a trainer, and then things made more sense to me. Elder L. had never held any
leadership positions in the mission prior to becoming my trainer, and he had probably wanted to
receive a trainee who would be helpless and would look up to him. I could not be the trainee that
Elder L. seemed to have wanted; although I looked up to Elder L. a lot at first, followed his lead
in missionary work, and wanted to learn from him because he had much more experience in missionary
work than I did, I also thought about ways that we might do things differently in order to apply
principles from Preach My Gospel (which we were required to study daily), and my Japanese was very
clean and progressed rapidly; I was able from the very beginning to talk with people and to
participate in lessons and in finding activities. In short, I was quite independent compared to
typical new missionaries.

Elder L. seemed especially displeased when during our second transfer together our investigator,
Harayama-san, asked me to be the one to baptize him. When Elder L. asked Harayama-san whom he would
like to perform the ordinance, Harayama-san paused for a moment and then turned toward me and said
he wanted me to do it. I did not have any expectations, and I would have been satisfied either way,
but Elder L. seemed to be supressing a negative reaction (hurt or resentment). Harayama-san's
pre-baptism photo (left to right: me, Harayama-san, Elder L.) I really cared about Harayama-san. We
met with him two or three times a week for more than a transfer to teach him all the lessons and
help him to stop smoking. He was my first baptism, and after I baptized him, when we were changing
into dry clothes, Harayama-san told me that it was the happiest day of his life.

Harayama-san was never confirmed, though. He did not receive the laying on of hands. Without letting
us know during our meeting before Harayama-san's baptism, the bishopric decided to delay
Harayama-san's confirmation due to the complications with his residency status. Sadly, for some
reason, Harayama-san never showed up again — he disappeared. Because Harayama-san had no phone, we
had always scheduled our appointments in person, but he didn't come to the next appointment that we
had scheduled, and he stopped coming to our English class and to church as well; we had no way of
knowing what had happened to him. My baptism photo with Harayama-san was posted in the weekly Kobe
mission email, but there was no new member in Fukuyama. It was difficult for me to accept what had
happened. I believed that Harayama-san was truly converted and was ready to enter in at the gate,
but Harayama-san had suddenly disappeared after receiving, in a sense, half a baptism (since LDS
doctrine holds that baptism is incomplete without the sealing of the gift of the Holy Ghost given in
the confirmation ordinance). I hoped that Harayama-san would show up at church again, but he never
did.

Throughout my time in Fukuyama, I continued to emphasize my spiritual experiences and to share my
testimony in my emails home:

> L.-choro and I get along pretty well, I'm glad he's my companion, and I know that Fukuyama is also
> the area that I'm supposed to be in right now — as my first area… …I am continually learning to

> Christ is true, and it is for everyone. The gospel is true, and I'm grateful to be out here
> sharing it.

After finishing my second transfer, I was told that I would be transferring to Imabari. I was
somewhat disappointed because I had expected to stay longer in Fukuyama and work toward some goals
that I had for the area, but I had a good attitude; I was sure that my transferring must be the
Lord's will, and I looked forward to working in my new area. My overall feelings toward my trainer
were not the best when we parted, but I tried to focus on good and happy thoughts and move forward
cleanly.

After transferring, I quickly fell in love with my new area and branch. The Imabari Branch consisted
of only about 20 active members, and the church building was actually a renovated recycle store.
There were few priesthood holders, some of the members had mental conditions, and there were some
significant relationship problems between certain members, but although I noticed these issues, I
was happy to be serving in Imabari. I wanted to do well with the members, I was glad to be teaching
more investigators than I had in Fukuyama, and I also liked my new companion, Elder Nelson. A few
days after transferring to Imabari, I wrote:

> …I've been [in Imabari] for less than a week so far, but I love it. It is a…beautiful area. From

> Horibata-san and Tetsuya-kun have also both committed to be baptized.

Things were not as great with our investigator situation as they seemed on the surface, though. Our
three most consistent investigators whom I mentioned in my first email home (above), for example,
each had significant issues that I failed to adequately make clear to my family and to my missionary
leaders (and even to myself, for that matter):

- Megumi-san was mentally retarded. Whether or not he truly needed to be taught and baptized is
  questionable. He could not have become a contributing member of the church (which the Imabari
  branch sorely needed) even if he were baptized. (He eventually stopped investigating after
  learning about the law of tithing.)
- Horibata-san was legitimately crazy (mentally ill). We met with him regularly because we could,
  but he never progressed.
- Tetsuya-kun was 16 years old (not old enough to be baptized without parental consent), and it
  eventually became clear that he was more interested in being friends with us than in joining the
  church.

Elder Nelson and I cared a lot about all of our investigators and wanted to help them. We seem to
have been prone to overlook or minimize their problems, though. After a couple weeks of meeting with
our investigators, I wrote,

> Megumi-san is golden. We have finished teaching him the commandments, and he will be baptized on

Even when Elder Nelson and I came to realize the severity of our investigators' problems, we
continued to do everything that we could to continue teaching them and trying to help them to
progress. In hindsight, we seem to have spent much of our time meeting with and struggling to meet
with people that did not truly have potential to become members of the church. Still, we had good
reason to be hopeful about Tetsuya-kun (our 16-year-old investigator) and about Precy and Jessie,
our Filipino investigators whom I introduced to my family in the following message:

> We…met Precy and Jessie… They are awesome…it was a fun visit. They are…loving people, and they are
> actually a referral from Jason, a member in Fukuyama (my last area). They already have faith in

In spite of my consistent optimism, and although we did have some good teaching experiences, making
progress with Tetsuya-kun and with Precy and Jessie throughout the transfer was more difficult than
Elder Nelson and I anticipated. Our other investigators obviously did not progress, either, and we
were not able to find new investigators.

Regardless of whether we got much done during our transfer together, I enjoyed working with Elder
Nelson. He was a very loving guy. He honestly was about as incompetent as my trainer had been,
comically so at times, but I got along much better with him than I did with my trainer. I felt like
I was a respected companion and friend rather than a resented underling.

When our transfer together ended, Elder Nelson transferred away to Mikki, and an Elder Rice came to
take his place. Over the next two transfers, Elder Rice would become one of my favorite and most
trusted companions and a positive influence on the remainder of my mission.

Elder Rice and I did not get along especially well at first, for the following reasons:

- He was not very happy to be in Imabari; he had previously been a zone leader in an area that he
  really loved, and Imabari was actually one of the two areas in the mission that he had hoped to
  never go to. I was bothered by his attitude toward Imabari; it was my second area and I loved it.
  Although I recognized that there were crazy people everywhere (Imabari and Shikoku as a whole
  contain many people with mental conditions and other disabilities) and that the branch had issues,
  I considered Imabari to be a beautiful area and as good a place to serve as any.
- His pride seemed to be hurt from dropping in position from zone leader to district leader; he
  wanted to continue being a zone leader. I disapproved of his desire to be a zone leader and of
  what I perceived to be him flaunting his prior position. I felt that he was coveting leadership
  positions, which could only be a sign of pride.
- He had some negative things to say about Japanese culture, particularly about the culture of shame
  and of collective behavior, and I sometimes got the impression that he did not really love
  Japanese people in general.

Elder Rice was a good person and a hard worker, though. He was good-natured, was much more competent
than my first two companions had been, could take critical feedback and grow from it, and could also
give critical feedback very constructively. He quickly broke me out of lazy habits that I had begun
to develop during my first three transfers (leaning on walls and rails while housing, not moving
quickly enough, etc.), and he helped me to improve various skills relevant to missionary work. He
helped me not only to work harder but also to enjoy myself more; we worked hard every day to find
and teach people, and on preparation days we did more adventurous things that I ever had done
before. I came to respect Elder Rice and to think of him as my real trainer. After our first few
weeks together, I wrote,

After turning 20, I wrote,

Proselytizing in Imabari certainly had its difficulties; Imabari had a reputation among missionaries
for a reason. Although it was a beautiful area and arguably had a few strong members, the Imabari
Branch was largely characterized by its mentally ill members. A significant percentage of the small
branch was mentally handicapped or mentally ill to varying extents, and it was not hard to see why;
every day proselytizing in Imabari was full of encounters with people who were mentally ill to some
extent. Unfortunately, the presence of members with mental (and/or financial) problems made it
difficult for the branch to attract and/or retain normal investigators, as I indirectly noted in an
email to my family:

> The branch did a mochitsuki [tradition rice-cake-making event] today, so we ate some…good mochi

> love her family. Unfortunately, there are some issues with branch members right now that are
> keeping her from being willing to learn the Gospel … so please pray for her and the Imabari
> branch.

There was nothing to do but to work hard and try to find those who would accept our message, though.
Elder Rice and I continued to work with the investigators whom I had taught with Elder Nelson —
including Tetsuya-kun, Horibata-san, and Precy and Jessie — and we also found and taught new
investigators. I wrote of some of our finding experiences in my emails home:

> …We went to visit Jessie on Sunday evening a couple weeks ago, but he wasn't in his apartment…we

We were excited about Jose and continued to meet with him off and on over the next several weeks,
but he did not progress. Seno-san, on the other hand, progressed rapidly; I regularly informed my
family of his progress:

> …[Seno-san] recognizes Elder Rice and I as the answer to his prayer to God to know the true faith,
> and so he has accepted fully everything that we have taught him. He is also reading the Book of

What I did not tell my family was that Seno-san was not right in the head. He seemed normal at
first, but he was a religious fanatic and likely had schizophrenia (or a different mental illness).
He believed that he received revelations from angels that he could see in his eyelids. When we
visited him at his apartment, there were salt containers at the corners of his door, and hanging on
his wall were multiple towels upon which many strange symbols were drawn in black marker. The
symbols were the marks of the angels that Seno-san could see in his eyelids. Both in private and in
our company, he prayed with his forehead pressed to the ground because he believed that he had
received a revelation that he must pray in that manner, and he had absolute confidence in other more
problematic revelations that he had received involving the Atonement of Jesus Christ and other
things.

Elder Rice and I were troubled by all of this, but Seno-san was extremely receptive to our
teachings, so we continued to work with him in the hope that we could help him to receive the Gospel
and to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Over the next couple weeks, he referred not only his
fiance but also his mother and his aunt, and although Yagi-san (his fiance) was slightly mentally
handicapped and would not be a real strength to the branch even if baptized, Seno-san's mother and
aunt (hereafter referred to as Seno-shimai and Nishi-shimai, respectively) were actually entirely
sane and were as incredibly receptive to our message as Seno-san himself. Our numbers kept getting
better and better as we continued to work with the Seno crew and with other existing and new
investigators. At one point, Elder Rice and I had seven people with dates set for baptism — the
highest number in the mission at the time:

> We currently have 7 baptisms scheduled. Those are Seno-kyodai, Yagi-shimai, Seno-shimai and
> Nishi-shimai, Precy and Jessie, and Higaki-kyodai.

Elder Rice and I felt that the Lord was rewarding us for our diligence. I continued to bare my
testimony and share spiritual thoughts in my weekly emails to my family:

> I'm so grateful to be out here serving the Lord. I know that the Church is true, and that the
> fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth. The Book of Mormon is true,
> and everyone through the power of the Holy Ghost can know the truth of our message. We are working

At the end of our two transfers together, Elder Rice transferred away (to Fukuyama, incidentally),
and I stayed in Imabari for a fourth transfer (my sixth transfer overall) and became the district
leader. My new companion was Elder Smart, my first junior companion. In my first email to my mission
president that transfer, I wrote,

> We weren't able to meet with three of our…yakusokusha [investigators with baptismal dates] (Precy,

Elder Smart and I got along pretty well. I felt that a lot of the time he had his brain turned off
and his mouth turned on, but I liked him and we stayed on good terms throughout our short transfer
together. I didn't feel very qualified to be a district leader, but I did my best throughout the
transfer. I planned district meetings carefully every week, and I also took follow-ups seriously (by
pondering, praying, and seeking revelation beforehand); fortunately for me, my district consisted
only of my own area and the neighboring sister area, Niihama, so my only follow-ups were with the
two Niihama sisters. Even with only two sisters to follow up with, though, I felt the weight of
leadership, and I felt that I had much to learn as a leader.

Elder Smart and I worked hard to keep Imabari's investigator pool strong by searching for new
investigators in addition to working with our current investigators. Our success in finding was
limited, but we talked with many people and had interesting experiences such as the following:

> …There's this door that I've been knocking on from time to time for over three transfers now,

Elder Smart and I had three baptisms that transfer — all people that Elder Rice and I had found
together: Seno-kyodai, Seno-shimai, and Nishi-shimai. Our efforts throughout the transfer revolved
around preparing this crew for baptism, and I regularly updated my family and my mission president
on their progress:

Sister Seno and Sister Nishi's pre-baptism photo (left to right: Okada-choro, Okada-shimai, Sister
Seno, Sister Nishi, me, Elder Smart) Seno-shimai and Nishi-shimai received baptism… I've been with
them from the beginning, ever since they came into contact with the missionaries through Seno-kyodai
(who, by the way, is scheduled to be baptized this upcoming Sunday. He quit smoking 11 days ago).
There's a Mission Theme in this mission, a series of short statements beginning with Christ is the
reason; . I won't write the whole thing, but the last part is this: Joy is the reward; . I really
understood that as I listened to Seno-shimai and Nishi-shimai bare their testimonies following the
baptismal service… I was able to participate in the teaching and baptism and confirmation of two
women who have truly become converted unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Seno's pre-baptism photo
Brother Seno was baptized on Saturday the 9th and confirmed at church on the 10th. Brother Seno was
so happy to get baptized. It was very hard for him to stop smoking — as he bore his testimony after
receiving baptism, he told the branch about how he used to smoke 50 cigarettes every day. Because of
his sleeping disorder, it is difficult to wake up in the morning and stay awake during the day
without tobacco. But his faith is strong, and now he has joined his mother and his aunt, who were
baptized last week! Sister Seno and Sister Nishi are awesome. They are so happy and so grateful to
be members of the church… I was very surprised when at the end of the transfer, I was promptly made
a zone leader and sent to Nishinomiya, the zone leader area for the Kobe Zone (including mission
headquarters): …I didn't even know what to think after I got the transfer call this morning.
President Zinke always calls the missionaries who will become zone leaders or trainers, and the
assistants call everyone else, so my heart started pounding as soon as I saw that President Zinke
was calling…

Mission: Nishinomiya (Transfers 7 – 8)

Shortly after entering Nishinomiya as a zone leader, I wrote the following to my mission president:
Dear President Zinke, …I like Elder Young a lot. He's a good elder…he seems to have a hold of the
big picture and of his purpose as a missionary. He's really good at stopping and talking with
people… I've been…impressed with how well he's able to use just his personality and personal
conviction, both in finding and teaching. Also he's a humble guy. He asks me questions about
Japanese all the time. I'm glad to have him as my senior companion, especially as a new zone leader.
There are lot of people in Nishinomiya. Lots of young people… And so many families. (That is our
focus in finding right now — we're looking for Nishinomiya's elect family.) … The reference to
Nishinomiya's elect family requires an explanation of my mission's so-called sheep revelations —
revelations of the number of elect in each area of the mission. Approximately one year prior to my
entrance into the mission field, under the direction of President Zinke (who was at the time
relatively new), the Kobe mission sought and allegedly received revelations for the number of elect
or sheep (i.e., the number of individuals prepared to receive the Gospel) living in each area of the
mission. All areas of the mission apparently also separately sought revelations for the number of
families included in their elect numbers. The purpose of the sheep revelations was to bolster
missionaries' faith and motivation by establishing that there truly were people prepared to receive
the Gospel and by providing numbers that missionaries could work toward as goals. I was told about
the sheep revelations from the beginning of my mission, but I did not think about them very much in
the beginning. I already had faith that there were people prepared to receive the Gospel, and the
exact numbers of prepared individuals did not especially matter to me. Although I believed
(passively) in the sheep revelations, I felt that my actions would be the same regardless of the
sheep numbers in that I would simply strive to follow the guidance of the Spirit and work
diligently. The sheep revelations were heavily emphasized by the mission president and upper
leadership of the mission; after my arrival in Nishinomiya as a zone leader, I took more notice of
the sheep numbers, and they became significant to the remainder of my mission. The sheep number for
Nishinomiya was nine, and there was supposed to be one family — hence my statement in my email to my
mission president that we were looking for Nishinomiya's elect family. To continue— The number of
people threw me off at first after being in Imbari for 4 transfers, but I'm a little more used to it
now. I also love the ward here, and the church building is beautiful. It was so good to be able to
sit in a chapel with pews on Sunday. I've been able to meet with several of our investigators
already, and there's a lot of potential. Unfortunately, 3 of the [investigators with dates set for
baptism] are planning to move away in the near future — Ryosuke to China, Umeda to Tokyo, and
Hobayashi is entering a police academy. [Police officers cannot be religiously affiliated in Japan.]
Katsuya should be baptized very soon, though, and I feel…good about him (as a person). The concern
with him is church attendance — he wants to come to church but has only been able to come one time
so far because of his work. He plans to change his job in April so that he can attend church weekly,
though, and then we should be able to baptize him after he hits his third week. Albert Mihata…has
been changing his mind a lot about the location of his baptism, where he will attend church after
baptism, etc. He lives in Kobe but there's a whole long story there that you might already know
about, and in the end he's been meeting with the missionaries in Nishinomiya and attending church
here. He talked with his mother about getting permission for baptism, and she actually ended up
calling and meeting with us — this morning. She felt like it's far too soon for him to be baptized,
and we talked a lot about Albert's motives for baptism, why baptism is important, etc. We ended up
postponing the baptism until next month to give her a chance to make sure that her son is going to
live by his commitments before she gives approval for him to be baptized. I was impressed with her
because she was not opposed to the church at all but was actually very logical and honest and wanted
to make sure that her son is going to practice the religion that he intends to join. I think that
the arrangment that we worked out was probably the best that could have been worked out. So we'll
keep working with Albert this month… Essentially, the number of investigators with baptismal dates
was three higher than it should have been when I entered the area, since Ryosuke-kun, Umeda-san, and
Hobayashi-san all soon moved away without being baptized and did not continue meeting with
missionaries. None of them likely intended to be baptized (being aware of their own situations), but
they agreed to set the dates as goals with my predecessor, an Elder George (a very faithful
missionary), perhaps in order to please him. Missionaries in general were desperate to raise their
numbers, so they often set baptismal dates for investigators who would not reasonably be able to be
baptized on those dates and/or kept the baptismal dates even after it was clearly impossible for
baptisms to occur on those dates. Because posing the baptismal invitation could be considered a sign
of faith, missionaries usually did not see anything wrong with doing so and were able to overlook
the possible unethicalness of setting unrealistic baptismal dates. I tried to be honest and
realistic with my numbers throughout my mission, but I was not an exception to the tendency to
somewhat inflate numbers at times. I was subject to the same pressures as other missionaries to do
my part by achieving high numbers, contributing to numerical mission goals, etc., and I felt these
pressures acutely as a leader in the mission. I did not realize until later the extent to which some
of my actions throughout my mission were motivated by numbers rather than by a desire for whatever
was legitimately best for my investigators. To continue— [To be honest,] I've had some anxiety about
being a zone leader… talking on the phone is [a weakness for me], and it sometimes takes me a while
to get used to people, which makes follow-ups kind of tough. But I'm trying to…just forget about
myself. I want to help this zone as much as I can — as much as the Lord will let me. I'm just not
quite comfortable with [zone leadership] yet. I'm glad to be in the same zone as Elder Greenburg.
Our relationship wasn't as good when we left the MTC as I wish it had been, because I corrected
misbehavior a lot without showing enough love. I hope that I'll have the chance to fix that to an
extent while we're close. I don't know if I've ever told you my theory about transfers, but you
might have picked up that I don't hold transfer preferences…because I trust that I will end up
wherever I am supposed to be. I came to feel that way more and more while I was living in Imabari.
That being said… If it's in line with the will of the Lord… I'm…waiting for a [Japanese] companion…
…Thanks for everything you do out here ~ Elder Fredericksen For the same reason that it was
sometimes difficult for me to comfortably talk with people on the streets, it was sometimes
difficult for me to comfortably talk with missionaries on the phone (until I got to know them, at
least). Also, for a fairly long time as a leader in the mission, I did not actually consider myself
to be qualified to guide or instruct other missionaries; I was considered a high-baptizing
missionary at that point, and my Japanese ability was widely recognized, but I felt like I still had
too much to learn about being a missionary. As I gained experience working with many missionaries
throughout my time as a leader, I gradually overcame this sense of inadequacy, realizing that all
missionaries needed help (with planning, thinking, Japanese, other skills, etc.) and that I was
capable of helping them. I was taught to have faith that each transfer, I was exactly where the Lord
intended me to be. Taking this to heart from the very beginning of my mission, I never held any
preferences for areas that I would like to serve in (or to never serve in). This passive,
not-my-will-but-Thine-be-done attitude extended both to areas and to leadership positions; i.e., I
had no aspirations other than to do my best with whatever assignments came my way. I believed that
in each of my areas, there were people whom I specifically was supposed to meet (investigators,
companions, etc.), and I considered everything to be an opportunity either to accomplish something
or to learn and grow. I considered being placed as Elder Greenburg's (my old MTC companion's) zone
leader to be an act of providence; I had been hoping for some time that I would eventually have the
opportunity to improve things between us and to be his friend. Although I believed that everything
regarding transfers was done according to the will of the Lord by revelation through the mission
president, I actually was not 100% passive. I wanted to have a Japanese companion, and as my mission
progressed, I started to worry that I would never receive one. I had difficulty believing that it
was the Lord's will for me to be neglected in terms of Japanese companions while others received
multiple Japanese companions, and I occasionally carefully reminded my mission president that I
would be happy to work with a Japanese missionary. Elder Young, being Australian, was my first
non-American companion (of the two that I had during my mission). He was a good person, but
unfortunately, our good relationship did not last long into our transfer together in Nishinomiya.
Our personalities were perhaps too different, and the difference in our cultures may also have
played a role. Still, I liked Elder Young and wanted to have a good relationship with him. Elder
Young and I sometimes had minor differences of opinion regarding certain issues relating to
missionary work and leadership, but we did not often disagree overtly. I remember only one actual
argument that we had. It was after I overheard Elder Young having the following conversation with
one of the district leaders (DL) whom we presided over:

- Elder Young: What's your goal for baptisms this week?
- DL: …[Uhhh, zero]…
- Elder Young: Well, why isn't it your sheep number?
- Elder Young: Where's your faith, elder? Don't you have faith that the Lord can have all of the
  elect lined up in front of the church to be baptized?
- Elder Young: I have my goal for baptisms set equal to my sheep number every week… so should you!
  It's all about faith… Inwardly, I was disgusted. Preach My Gospel teaches to set reasonable,
  achievable, and stretching goals while heeding the promptings of the Spirit. Elder Young, however,
  was teaching our district leader to be irrational, and he was doing so in the name of faith.
  Missionaries are required to have investigators attend church at least three times before
  baptizing them, so it would be wrong for our district leader's area to have set their goal for
  baptisms in the coming week equal to their sheep number; they did not have any investigators
  eligible to be baptized. Elder Young had been setting our baptism goal at nine every week without
  my knowledge. The faith talk that he was having with a subordinate was one that he had never had
  with his companion. My practice was to mark a zero in my planner for the weekly baptism goal
  unless we had an investigator scheduled to be baptized and/or a legitimate reason to hope for and
  work toward the baptism of an eligible investigator(s) who had attended church three or more
  times. I talked with Elder Young after he finished his phone call with the district leader, but we
  did not reach an agreement. Elder Young did not respect my opinion because for him, it was a
  matter of faith. I never forgot this experience. I was impressed by our investigators, as I noted
  in an email home soon after entering the area: …I've been…impressed with [Katsuya-kun's] desires
  and spirit. He stopped smoking, is living the Law of Chastity in spite of his girlfriend, [plans
  to change] his job at the beginning of April so that he can keep the Sabbath Day holy and attend
  church weekly… he really wants to be baptized and follow Jesus Christ. Another investigator who we
  call Kakipi is also looking to be baptized in a month or so. He has been confined to a wheelchair
  ever since a car accident many years ago — he's in his 40s. He's super funny — I think he relies
  on his humor to give meaning and flavor to his life. He has changed a lot since beginning to meet
  with missionaries. He didn't have any intention of becoming a Christian at the beginning, but he
  has really opened his heart and his desires have changed. Little by little… We've been working the
  most with Albert. That's his middle name — he was born in America but his parents are Japanese.
  He's a tough one — his story is kind of incredible. One thing that is pretty indisputable is that
  God has…directed and guided his life from a very young age up until now so that he would receive
  the restored Gospel. He wants to be baptized, but due to family issues (mostly between him and his
  mother at the present time, since his father is working in China), he cannot receive parental
  consent. But I have faith that God wants him to be baptized and will prepare a way, and we are
  trying to help Albert to have that faith as well. Katsuya-kun's pre-baptism photo (left to right:
  Elder Young, Katsuya-kun, Brother Senba, me) We knew that church attendance was a problem for
  Katsuya-kun, but his faith seemed sincere. Elder Young wanted to get him baptized before
  transferring; he acquired permission to have Katsuya-kun baptized the morning of his third Sunday
  of church attendance rather than the following week, and according to plan, Katsuya-kun was
  baptized by his fellowshipper, Brother Senba. Katsuya-kun stopped being able to attend church
  immediately after his baptism because of his job, and he did not return to activity during my time
  in the mission field. Elder Young and Kakipi-kyodai Elder Young and I worked with Kakipi a lot
  during our transfer together. He had a rather lonely lifestyle, so we sometimes ate out with him,
  and we often played ping-pong with him before or after our lessons in the church. We referred
  Albert to the Kobe area after he began attending church there, and he was later baptized by the
  missionaries there after receiving his mother's permission. Elder Young and I spent a lot of time
  streeting (contacting people on the streets in order to find new investigators) in Nishinomiya. We
  struggled to find new investigators, though (as almost every area in the mission did).
  Insufficient unity between the two of us may have made it difficult for me to give my best effort
  in our finding activities; I would often allow my companion to take the lead in making contacts.
  At times, though, I had good finding experiences. In one of my weekly emails to the mission
  president, I wrote the following of an experience I had during a companion exchange with one of my
  zone members: …Elder Young and I had the opportunity to do an exchange…with Elder Filianga and
  Elder Hapi; I stayed in Nishinomiya with Elder Hapi while Elder Young went to Kitarokko with Elder
  Filianga. That was a…valuable exchange for me… …Working with a new missionary put me back in the
  zone. I was [proselytizing] like I never have before, and it felt…good… And I should be working
  like that every day… There's no excuse for holding myself back… Hapi-choro and I sought the
  guidance of the Spirit and were blessed with a wonderful finding experience. Elder Young and I
  have recently been spending a lot of time at a [university] very close to the church in
  Nishinomiya. It's a great place for finding…because classes have started again and there are…tons
  of young people walking around that won't blow us off as soon as we start talking to them. So that
  was where I went with Hapi-choro…we talked with a bunch of people and got a couple phone numbers,
  and then I felt like we should start walking down a street leading back toward the church. We did
  so and ran into a guy that I recognized! A few weeks ago I pounded rice with him at a mochitsuki
  [traditional Japanese rice-cake-making event]!! His name's Okakin…he's an investigator now. We hit
  it off on the street because…he remembered me, and I remembered what he looked like [at least].
  Turns out he's a student at that university, on his fourth year. He took me and Hapi-choro on
  campus to introduce us to some of his friends, and we planned to meet again at 6:30 after his
  class ended. So we went to the church together, sang a hymn in the chapel…had a short first
  lesson… I have a lot of faith that we were guided to him and he was guided to us. [After] that
  exchange, I think Young-choro and I are working together better in finding now. We've been finding
  a lot more new people, including a couple Chinese people that I have confidence in, and I feel
  like we have every possibility of obtaining the standards of excellence this week.… Neither Okakin
  nor any of the potential investigators whom I mentioned actually progressed at all, but missionary
  work would have been very difficult psychologically if I did not have confidence in people. Having
  confidence in people basically equated to having hope — hope that our efforts as missionaries
  would bear fruit. Throughout my mission, I was confident that the potential investigators and new
  investigators whom my companions and I found were guided to us by the Lord and would (or at least
  could) progress as investigators. Missionaries throughout the mission commonly considered the
  finding of a new investigator to be a miracle, and so did I. When potential investigators and new
  investigators quickly disappeared without progressing, we would simply move forward without
  considering the implications for our prior certainty that we had experienced a miracle and
  witnessed the Lord's hand in our work. Sometimes new investigators did progress, even if most of
  the time they did not. For those who disappeared and/or did not progress, we could hope that seeds
  had been planted in their hearts. In my email to my mission president, I mentioned that I felt
  that Elder Young and I could obtain the standards of excellence. Standards of excellence can be
  found in missions throughout the world. They are essentially sets of numbers that each
  companionship in a mission is expected to strive to achieve and maintain. The standards of
  excellence were notoriously difficult to achieve in my mission. Even among the upper leadership of
  the mission, achieving the standards of excellence really was considered to be a miracle. Shortly
  before I became a zone leader, zone leaders were told not to initiate companion exchanges until
  they achieved the standards of excellence. At the time, no one had the standards of excellence;
  zone leaders were somewhat dismayed. We had a responsibility to train and assist the district
  leaders, but we were unable to do so through companion exchanges because our numbers were not at
  the standards of excellence. The companionship exchange that Elder Young and I conducted with the
  Kitarokko elders had in fact been initiated by our district leader, Elder Filianga, who was
  serving in Kitarokko and was not bound by the standards of excellence, rather than by us as his
  zone leaders. My zone leader companions and I tried hard to raise our numbers so that we could
  please our mission president, be an example to other missionaries, fulfill our responsibilities as
  zone leaders, and, of course, help the sheep in our areas. We desired to achieve the standards of
  excellence, and we had the faith that it was possible for us to achieve the standards of
  excellence by relying on the Lord. The standards of excellence were a heavy burden to bear as a
  zone leader. Miraculous success did not often come, and when the numbers did not come no matter
  how hard we worked, I sometimes felt like I was failing as a missionary and as a zone leader. I
  wanted to do my best and fulfill all of my responsibilities both as a missionary and as a zone
  leader, but I felt at times that I was prevented from doing so by my inability to accomplish
  numbers that were widely considered to be miraculously high. I suppressed feelings of
  disheartenment or failure, though, because I had been taught that such feelings were antithetical
  to faith. Praying, seeking revelation, relying on the Lord, having a good attitude, working hard,
  following the Spirit, being faithful, applying principles from our missionary training plans and
  other sources — none of these methods in any combination seemed to work reliably. (Diligence and a
  good attitude seemed to be more reliable predicators of numerical success than anything else, but
  even these did not guarantee anything.) Because we were faithful, though, we attributed to these
  methods all of our good experiences and successes in missionary work. The tendency of many
  missionaries to analyze their efforts and wonder what they were doing wrong inspired multiple
  missionary training plans. As a zone leader, I became highly familiar with the training plans and
  instructed my zone members in their application to missionary work. At the end of the transfer,
  Elder Young transferred away and I stayed in Nishinomiya: …We got transfer calls this morning, and
  I'll be staying here in Nishinomiya. Elder Young will be transferring out to Shimogamo (in Kyoto),
  and I'll be training a new zone leader, Elder Carter! I've heard good things about him… A few days
  after transfer, I wrote the following: I gave a talk in sacrament meeting yesterday about aquiring
  Christ-like attributes …it was a good chance to stretch my Japanese. Young-choro was…asked to give
  the talk, but then he went and transferred out to Shimogamo. A 21-year-old guy named Vincent came
  to church for the first time with us yesterday…! He's…a referral from a member living in Akashi…
  it was very cool [to receive a referral]…he actually has decent Japanese (he's been studying for a
  couple years and is pretty smart) so he understood the drift of my talk, and I heard later from
  the member that referred him that he …enjoyed church and couldn't get over…my Japanese… Next time
  we meet, I get to tell him that it's thanks to God… I'm looking forward to seeing him again. He
  was a Christian when he was younger, but he doesn't believe in anything in particular anymore… [I
  can tell] his friend living in Akashi cares about him. The key to the future growth of the Church
  lies in member missionary work, not in the full-time missionaries going and trying to talk to each
  person on the streets or knocking doors…according to Spencer W. Kimball, Gordon B. Hinckley and
  others. What I've found is that especially in a place like Japan where most people have an
  inherent sense of distrust or disinterest toward religion, we as missionaries first have to try to
  somehow quickly establish a relationship of trust with each person that we talk to. We have to
  quickly help them understand [who we are] as missionaries (we are human, we are volunteers, we
  care about them, etc.) without scaring them, being overbearing, etc. It's what we have to do, and
  it's a great thing, but it is not as great as members and missionaries working together. [At any
  rate], things are good out here! My first week working with Carter-choro has been pretty good. We
  have some…solid goals for this transfer… And we're still enjoying having the university by the
  church. We found this guy Julius who's from Uganda and is studying there…it was crazy hearing
  about what goes on back in his home country. We should have him at church next week… Elder Carter
  and I met with Vincent a few times over the next few weeks. He was courteous and intelligent, and
  I really liked him. However, he researched church teachings and found a lot of material that was
  disturbing to him. Due to selective retention, I cannot remember more than that it was largely
  teachings of Spencer W. Kimpball and Brigham Young that were problematic. He always gave us a
  chance to explain the materials that he found, and he was respectful, but he eventually decided to
  stop meeting with us and learning about the church. I felt let down by that; I cared about
  Vincent, considered him a friend, and wanted him to progress, but it did not turn out that way.
  Julius was a one-time encounter. The fact that I included him in my email home probably reflects
  my desperation, hope, and eagerness for new investigators at the time. Julius did not come to
  church, though, and we were not able to find him again. My companion, Elder Carter, was a great
  guy. He was very sincere and diligent. Unfortunately, while rebounding from the disrespect that I
  had sensed during my time with Elder Young, I was too hard on Elder Carter; I often chastised him
  for skills-related issues throughout our transfer together. I likely hurt him in the same way that
  I had been hurt, and I regretted it afterward until I had the chance to apologize to him multiple
  times. The Kobe mission, like many other missions throughout the world, regularly created
  mission-wide baptism goals. I mentioned one of these mission-wide goals to my family in an email
  toward the end of my transfer with Elder Young: …We are working toward a goal as a mission right
  now. That is, that every companionship in the mission will baptize on Mother`s Day… Because we
  love our moms and we love our brothers and sisters in Japan… Right now my companion and I have one
  investigator, Kakipi, scheduled to be baptized on Mother's Day. But we need (and he needs) your
  prayers; he has big Word of Wisdom struggles, and he's currently working to stop smoking. We still
  have to tackle coffee, tea, and alcohol. We also are working hard to find new investigators,
  especially a family, so that we can baptize on Mother's Day and from there on out. Over the next
  several weeks into my transfer with Elder Carter, I continued to update my family on Kakipi's
  progress: …Kakipi is doing well! Maybe. He has decreased his smoking by about half, so he's
  somewhere between 5 to 10 cigarettes a day right now. He has the desire to stop smoking and the
  desire to be baptized, but he struggles a bit with willpower (and that is actually at least
  partially due to minor brain damage caused by the accident that put him in a wheelchair). We're
  planning on teaching him the Stop Smoking Plan next time we meet, which is a pretty powerful
  system of 15 steps to be followed for 7 days that is apparently used by missionaries in many
  countries… It will come down to his commitment to follow the steps perfectly for a week; if he
  does that, he will be a non-smoker. Kakipi…is one of the funniest people I've ever met… Kakipi is
  still doing about the same. He's good and still has desire, but his smoking is staying about the
  same, probably averaging around 6 a day. We're planning to teach him the Stop Smoking Plan this
  week — which we were planning to teach last week, but it didn't work out… I love Kakipi-kyodai…
  And, in the end… …I have some bad news. Kakipi-kyodai has decided that for the time being he wants
  to continue smoking… We are still working with him, but that was pretty sad, and baptism's off the
  table for now… I was …surprised that he changed his mind like that, because his will and desire to
  be baptized has been so much stronger recently, but Satan …works on people… We'll just continue
  strengthening him and helping him the best we can with the Lord's help, so that he can use his
  agency the right way and receive baptism. We almost baptized Kakipi. The assistants came to take
  care of his baptismal interview, he passed the interview, and we prepared his baptismal service.
  On the Sunday that he was supposed to be baptized, though, he smoked in the restroom inside the
  church. One of the members who sometimes co-taught with us could smell the smoke in the bathroom
  and found ashes, so he told us, and we decided that we needed to postpone the baptism. When we
  talked with Kakipi about it, though, he got fed up with the situation and told us that he liked
  smoking and was going to keep doing it. I found the situation to be somewhat disturbing for
  multiple reasons:
- Kakipi-kyodai had not been honest with us about his progress.
- Neither my companion nor I had been able to accurately discern his true progress.
- My companion and I had been fixated upon meeting our goal of baptizing Kakipi-kyodai on Mother's
  Day and doing our part for the mission baptism goal, but we failed to do so.
- While preparing for baptism with us, Kakipi-kyodai was still smoking and intended to be baptized
  anyway. Did he understand the purpose and nature of baptism? Had we, his missionaries, been
  teaching him properly?
- Kakipi-kyodai passed his baptismal interview by answering one or more of the questions
  dishonestly, and none of us were any the wiser.
- Kakipi-kyodai's smoking problem was not 100% out of the blue. Hoping that Kakipi-kyodai could just
  be baptized without any problems, I had overlooked my uncomfortable suspicions that Kakipi-kyodai
  was still smoking and was not being honest with us. By ignoring those concerns rather than
  addressing them sooner, had I not allowed the situation to become worse than it would otherwise
  have been?
- The reason I had ignored my concerns was that I had wanted the baptism to happen — and I had
  wanted the baptism to happen on a certain day. Were my desires pure?
- In a complete reversal, it seemed that Kakipi-kyodai no longer even wanted to be baptized at all.
  Had we failed as his missionaries? Elder Carter and I continued to meet with Kakipi, and we made
  it clear that we still cared about him and that we…wanted him to trust us and be honest with us.
  (A couple transfers down the road, Kakipi was baptized by another set of missionaries.) During an
  exchange with my district leader (which was initiated by him rather than by my companion or me,
  since my companion and I were not at the standards of excellence at the time), I had a
  faith-building experience with finding and teaching: …we talked to a 21-year-old guy named Aki by
  Kwansei Gakuin University here in Nishinomiya. From there, he walked with us to the church so that
  we could show him around inside the church and talk more, and we ended up having about a 45-minute
  lesson with him there! We did a little tour of the church, ending in the chapel… then we asked him
  if he could talk for another 20 minutes or so and he said yeah, so we started the lesson by
  singing I Am a Child of God together out of a hymn book and saying a prayer, and Aki touched his
  chest and said he felt some kind of warm feeling that he couldn't describe. !!! So we explained to
  Aki that he was feeling God's love through the Spirit, and we taught him about our relationship
  with God and about Jesus Christ, and how by following Jesus Christ we can return again to the
  presence of our Heavenly Father. Last thing we did, we took him to another special place in the
  church: the baptismal font. We opened it up and introduced the doctrine of baptism, and Aki asked
  what a person would have to do in order to be baptized… We have another lesson scheduled for this
  week! ( : It was a simple but…faith-building experience. Aki lived in America for two years, and
  he told us that he has learned about Christianity in a knowledge way, but that talking with us he
  felt something of it in his heart for the first time. It was a confirmation to me that anyone can
  feel God's love, anyone can feel the Spirit if they will open their heart. I wrote to my family of
  another experience that I had with Elder Carter toward the end of the transfer: A couple weeks ago
  we were going through old Eikaiwa student records and I felt like calling a Murakami-san, so I
  did… and she couldn't come back to Eikaiwa because of work, but she set up a lesson appointment!
  It turns out that Murakami-san only came to Eikaiwa one time, and that was several months ago, but
  she has a good image of and interest in Christianity and the missionaries, so she agreed to meet.
  When we met with her for the first time, we taught simply about God… and the Spirit was there with
  us testifying of those simple truths — that God is our Heavenly Father, that He loves us, that He
  sent Jesus Christ so that we could be able to return to Him… For God so loved the world, that he
  gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life. (John 3:16) Then when we met her for the second time the other day, she had lots
  of …good questions ranging from how we can return to God after death to how we can overcome
  feelings of regret… she…felt the Spirit during that lesson. She said that she felt peace, and it
  was clear that she enjoyed the meeting… we had to tell her that time was up ( : It was…cool to see
  how much her interest grew from the first time we met to the second time because of what she felt
  while hearing the message. At the end of the transfer, I wrote the following to my family: One
  thing that has been tough recently is that a few investigators have dropped for the time being,
  for various reasons. Vincent (no longer open to hearing LDS teachings), Nishimura (can't meet
  until August), Okakin (doesn't want to talk about religion)…that has been hard, and
  Kakitani-kyodai's and Atsushi-kun's progression has been pretty slow recently, so Elder Carter and
  I have of course been feeling the need to be teaching more people — which means first, finding
  more people. So what did we do? We talked with all the people on the streets like we do every day,
  and yesterday we found a…nice guy who said we can come visit him this next Saturday or Sunday to
  share our message with him and his family (wife and son)! better, he gave us his phone number and
  showed us where he lives… I would say I'm excited to go visit them this weekend, but instead I'm
  excited for my companion and Elder Aono, because… we got transfer calls this morning, and I'm
  transferring!… to the most dense city area in the mission: Abeno, at the heart of Osaka. My
  companion will be Elder Ray, and we'll be the zone leaders for Osaka. I'm looking forward to
  serving in Abeno but I'm sad to be leaving Nishinomiya already! I've been here for two transfers,
  but it's passed …quickly and I…love this area…next week the email will be coming from Osaka.

Mission: Abeno (Transfers 9 – 11)

My first two weeks in Abeno, I wrote the following messages to my family: …I'm officially past my
half-way mark in Japan. A little less than 11 months left… I've been in Abeno for two days, and it
has been crazy…really eye-opening! Our apartment is on the 11th floor (out of 15) in a high rise… My
companion's Elder Ray, and it's been fun working with him here the last couple days, we get along
well. Probably the best I've gotten along with any of my companions so far, actually. I'm excited to
see what happens this transfer. We're working with a pool of over 20 investigators, 2 of whom we
found yesterday, and 3 of them are scheduled to be baptized… Brother [Sakamoto], who met with us for
the first time on Friday (my first night in Abeno) just committed yesterday to be baptized next
month!… So investigators are coming along…well…I'm expecting miracles… I got the package and…ate the
coconut bread!!! It was very good, did Matthew make it? The side of the table where I had it sitting
during the week got shiny because of the coconut oil in it. The pecans are really good too, I
haven't finished them yet. And the roasted okra chips reminded me of back when we used to eat at
Black Eyed Pea and I would always get fried okra… I'm sorry, but I actually don't have time to tell
y'all very much again this week. The week passed by super quickly because we had a couple companion
exchanges. On Thursday, the APs came to Abeno to work with Elder Ray and me. I worked with
Hayward-choro, and that was good… Then on Friday, Elder Ray and I did an exchange with the Habikino
elders, Yoshida-choro and Harris-choro…I was in Habikino for the day with Yoshida-choro and had the
chance to teach an investigator there who should be baptized in August. During the exchange with the
APs, we got in contact with and taught a lesson to Misaki-shimai, a former investigator. She was
actually found the first time back when Hayward-choro was serving in Abeno several months ago, and
she was very solid, but then she disappeared later on. But she finally met with us again, and she
committed to continue praying and reading the Book of Mormon and coming to church even if she cannot
get baptized right now (her mother is opposed to baptism, which is what caused her to disappear last
time)… Then she called us the next day and said that she had prayed, and she was crying and it was
pretty clear that the Spirit had worked on her. And she came to church on Sunday ( : One more
thing…we just taught a Taiwanese investigator named Peter (we teach him in English). Today was our
third time meeting him, and we reviewed about God and taught about prophets, Joseph Smith, and the
Book of Mormon. Then we gave him a Chinese Book of Mormon…he was way happy, and he said the closing
prayer and said something like my body is hot, but my heart is warm… and it was really funny… it is
hot out here now… and really humid. But it's just part of the experience, nothing to hold us back!
The next week, I wrote to my mission president, …it's been another good week in Osaka! It was
probably kind of rough, actually. But what I'm feeling is something close to excitement. Or
determination…to help the people in our teaching pool that are in a position to hear and accept
truth and to progress. On Tuesday, Ray-choro and I felt like we should go to a neighborhood called
Nagayoshi Rokutan at the southeast corner of our area, and on our way there we ran into a guy named
[Sakamoto]. He wasn't…interested at first, but we exercised some blue door power and ended up
teaching him a first lesson at a nearby park. Then we met him for the second time at the church on
Saturday. He came to the appointment even though he was recovering from a cold ( : and one of the
things that he told us he wanted to know was why we were trying/working so hard — why we came here
all the way from America, etc. So we taught him the Restoration and gave him a Book of Mormon! We
should be meeting with him again this week. Peter, our Taiwanese investigator, is doing great. We
just met with him a bit ago, my companion and I took a break from email to teach him. We taught him
about the Plan of Salvation, and he understood so well. Which is a miracle really, because we're
teaching him in English. And it was exactly what he had been wondering about and wanted to hear
today. He is …recognizing the hand of God in his life. And he changed his work schedule so he can
come to church on Sundays from now on!! ( : There are a couple families that we are teaching now, a
Filipino family and a Japanese family. I love them a lot. The Filipino family (…a family of 3…) is
reading the Book of Mormon, praying, and meeting us every week — they're progressing. ( : The
Japanese family (the Adachi family) is also a family of 3, but so far we've only been meeting with
the dad and 8-year-old daughter. The mom is concerned about what people will think if they see
Christian missionaries coming into their home, so that's the obstacle with meeting them all together
that we need to overcome, but the dad and daughter meet with us every week before our free English
class, and they are great. It was a …cool experience listening to Rika, the daughter, pray to
Heavenly Father to close our lesson last week. The things that I see around me every day, especially
in this city, remind me of the importance of the Gospel and of the blessings that it brings in this
life. The Gospel of Jesus Christ, the truths that Heavenly Father has revealed to us through His
prophets, are the key to happiness, security and purpose in this life, and eternal life in the world
to come. I'm grateful for the chance that I have to share these most important things with my
brothers and sisters in Japan. As was my habit throughout my mission, I tried to emphasize good,
spiritually inspiring experiences and to omit bad experiences as much as possible in my emails to my
family and my mission president. During more difficult portions of my mission, I therefore would
have little to say — to my family, at least, as demonstrated by the following email that I wrote to
my family: It's been an interesting week. My favorite part was our lesson with Peter yesterday. He
came to church, and we taught him a lesson during 3rd hour about the Sabbath, church attendance, the
Holy Ghost, and baptism… The Spirit was there, and Peter is so receptive to the Spirit and to
guidance from God. He was hesitant about baptism at first just because he doesn't understand
everything yet and has some Word of Wisdom concerns, but we opened up and testified to him, and he
set a goal to be baptized on August 25. ( : Sorry for the short email… I love y'all a lot! In this
case, I felt the need to write a separate email to my mother so that she would not think that I was
simply neglecting to write more: Dear Mom, Sorry my email was short. We are short on time (I still
need to write my president's letter, I just finished sending in forms), and we have plans today to
visit the Osaka Castle today with our district… but another reason the emails have been short the
last couple weeks is that the Abeno area has kind of been deteriorating. Investigators have been
dropping and we haven't been teaching too many lessons. I'm trying to not be discouraged about that,
but it does make the emails shorter. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this in an email home, but
my companion is crazy. I think that he has been mentally and emotionally scarred by his family
situation growing up and other influences… he has pretty bad anger issues, and he is just kind of
nuts in some ways. I've had to give him some correction, and there have been a couple explosions
[from him]… I love my companion, and he can be funny, but things get pretty bad sometimes, and it's
been tough to work with him sometimes. I'm just trying to make it though the transfer on good terms,
and I hope that the companion I get next transfer has a solid head on his shoulders. When I first
started working with Elder Ray, I thought that he was a nice person with an interesting, kind of
dark sense of humor. He would say some pretty unexpected, funny things about people, places, and
situations. As I continued to work with Elder Ray, though, I gradually realized that his dark humor
was actually not humor at all. He was truly a hateful person (i.e., he was extremely quick to hate
people), and he was not quite right in the head. One of the reasons that it took me some time to
realize this was that I genuinely wanted to like my companion and to agree with him as much as
possible. He was the area senior, so my instinct was to trust his evaluations of members and
investigators. My early opinions of certain members and investigators were tainted by Elder Ray's
hateful perspective, and I did not realize until later that I actually liked and wanted to work with
those people and that Elder Ray's perspective was not right. I soon became one of Elder Ray's
objects of hatred, unfortunately, and my life was hell after that. His negative feelings toward me
likely were born the first time that I tried to correct his Japanese. In spite of the fact that
Elder Ray was the most senior mission that I had worked with up to that point (15th transfer), his
Japanese was unbelievably terrible, and he could not receive constructive correction at all. I had
been warned about this by Elder Smart (who had been Elder Ray's companion before becoming my
companion in Imabari), but I was not prepared for the explosions that resulted from my early
attempts to help Elder Ray with his Japanese. Elder Ray often became frustrated and angry with
people whom we contacted during streeting and housing, and I had to stop him and tell him not to be
angry — even though that consistently resulted in his anger being redirected toward me. (More than
once, Elder Ray even began yelling at me in public in a fit of rage, and all I could do was try to
calm him down and help him to realize that it was not the right time and place.) I felt that being
rude to people would only hurt our cause as missionaries; I did not want anyone to think of LDS
missionaries as crazy, angry people. I could not understand how any LDS missionary could be so
hateful and angry. Fortunately, Peter and Ken and Rika — our favorite investigators — were never the
objects of his ire. Those three were very important to me, and perhaps I relied on them to some
extent to dispel some of the darkness from my life. Aside from these investigators (and perhaps
others whom we were simply unable to meet with), the exemptions from Elder Ray's hatred seemed only
to be little girls (toward whom he was creepy) and some truly angelic church members. I eventually
talked with Elder Kershiznik, one of the assistants, and let him know that I woud not be able to
make it through a second transfer with Elder Ray. Elder Ray had actually been Elder Kershiznik's
second companion, so Elder Kershiznik understood immediately and promised to take care of it for me.
I was so desperate that I did not even bother to think about how transfers were supposed to be
decided through revelation; I was sure that the Lord's will could not be for me to spend another
transfer with Elder Ray, anyway. I truly felt that Elder Ray hated me sometimes, but I managed to
avoid hating Elder Ray. I asked him some questions and found out that he had a difficult childhood
and that his dad is clinically insane. Things made more since to me then, and I was able to
empathize with Elder Ray enough to not hate him. I recognized that if his dad was clinically insane,
Elder Ray's issues were also likely attributable to an actual physiological problem or chemical
imbalance. One thing that truly bothered me, though, was that Elder Ray was a zone leader. I could
not understand how he could be a zone leader. He was not someone that could be a good example and an
effective teacher to other missionaries; he was not right in the head, and he was quick to hate
people without knowing them. Would the Lord really inspire the mission president to place such a
missionary as a zone leader? I knew that Elder Ray did not belong in his position as a zone leader
and that it therefore could not have been the will of the Lord for Elder Ray to be in that position.
Perhaps one of the reasons that I was willing to request to Elder Kershiznik that Elder Ray be
transferred away was that I was already aware at that point that transfers were decided not by the
Lord but by imperfect men — men who hopefully did their best to make informed and/or spiritually
inspired decisions but who nevertheless were liable to make sub-optimal transfer decisions without
adequate information. I found out later that Elder Ray had requested to be made a zone leader. The
other missionaries his age had all been made zone leaders, and he felt left out, so he asked
President Zinke to make him a zone leader, and President Zinke made him a zone leader. I cannot
confirm this information to be 100% accurate, but it came from a missionary supposedly familiar with
what had happened, and it is consistent with other observations I made about transfers throughout my
mission (e.g., my trainer becoming my trainer shortly after requesting to be made a trainer). The
final week of the transfer, when we received transfer calls, I was told that I would remain in
Abeno; that my new companion would be Elder Mergist, whom I would train as a new zone leader; and
that Elder Ray would transfer to Amagasaki as a district leader. I wrote the following to my mission
president: I made it through another week… Ray-choro and I had a couple more learning
experiences…we're cool now, but those episodes have their consequences as far as having the Spirit
in the work. I think that my self-control has been getting chipped away, too, because when he blew
up yesterday, that was the first time that I came close to striking him (my heart was
beating…quickly, and I just had to breathe deeply and get past the tondemonai [ridiculous,
outlandish, nonsense] things he was saying). I've…enjoyed some aspects of this last transfer, but it
has been draining. I feel like a week or two ago I dropped into survival mode, and I haven't put my
all into the work at all since then because I just wanted to make it though the transfer. I feel
sorry that that happened. I'm…happy with the way transfers worked out. I never thought that I'd
actually get to be companions with Mergist-choro, and I'm…looking forward to that now. I hope that
we will get along as well as we did in the MTC because I need that now, and Abeno needs it — a pair
of missionaries that will be unified and that both desire to learn and improve. Ray-choro seems
happy to be going to Amagasaki, too… Peter, our yakusokusha, wasn't able to meet yesterday because
he had to work until 3 in the morning and he overslept. So it looks like the next time we meet with
him will probably be after transfers. I am really excited for Peter. He is…seeking God's guidance in
his life through prayer, and he is relying on God in his trials as well — in other words, he's
exercising faith. One of the last things he said in the email he sent me last night was, Please
Fred, pray for me, I need help, and I pray for help to our Heavenly Father, too. Thank you… and the
last thing he said was, let's pray, I will pray, and please pray for me, brother. Thank you. (He is
having some struggles with his current job that are making his life tough, but he has prayed about
it and decided that he needs to seek a different job.) From the things he says and especially from
listening to his prayers during lessons, I can tell that he understands his relationship with God.
As we've been doing the Testimony Development Review for him, it seems like he might not understand
as much about the role of the Savior, so we will make sure to teach him more about Jesus Christ and
the Atonement and to make connections to Christ and the Atonement every time we teach. Also, I think
that banana chocolate chip bread may have helped get us in on a…special family (the credit goes to
the Lord for the inspiration to bake banana chocolate chip bread for them). Ken and his 8-year-old
daughter Rika have been meeting with us once a week for a while now, right before Eikaiwa. They are
awesome, but what has been holding them back is that Rika's mom woud not come with them to the
church to meet missionaries and woud not let them have us over to their home for fear of what other
people might think. Ken is super busy, so with that restriction he could only meet with us once a
week, but if the mom was on board then we could meet more, and she could also has the possibility of
attending church with Rika (not to mention they could be united as a family in learning about the
Gospel). So we made banana chocolate chip bread in the hope that it would soften the mother's heart
so that she would meet with us. We gave it to Ken and Rika at Eikaiwa to take home and eat as a
family, and I got a phone call from them later that night and got to talk to the mom! That was the
first time she has talked with the missionaries. At any rate, Ken said that they want to have us
come over sometime next (this) week if possible, and the mom wants me to teach her the recipe for
banana chocolate chip bread too! All three of them believe in God and Jesus Christ, and Ken and Rika
know about (and are not opposed to) baptism. This family has great potential. ( : We've also started
working with a big part member/less active family — the Teraokas. This was arranged by
Teraoka-shimai (she is active). They want to have us over once a week from now on, so I am excited
for them too. They are a good group, and their hearts seem open. And they would be a strength to the
Abeno ward! I think that is about all the updates for this week. We haven't been teaching many
lessons recently, but I believe that things will pick back up… Transfers happened, and the blackest
portion of my mission ended. I was relieved to be placed with a companion whom I already knew and
considered to be a friend (Elder Mergist and I knew each other from the MTC; he had been in the
group immediately senior to mine). The apartment dynamic changed greatly because Abeno became a
four-missionary area; Elder Mergist and I were joined by Elder Fernandes and a new missionary named
Elder Spilker (Elder Fernandes's trainee). The first week of the new transfer, I wrote to my family,
…It's been a great first week of the transfer!…it has been really interesting working with my new
companion Elder Mergist for the last few days. And…interesting to be living with four people instead
of just as a companionship of two [for the first time]. Elder Fernandes and Elder Spilker are the
other two missionaries serving in Abeno right now. Elder Spilker is a new missionary from Sandy,
Utah, and Elder Fernandes is from Brazil… Peter (our Taiwanese investigator) is doing great, but he
needs all of our prayers. He has been working at a ramen shop, but he is quitting that job because
it has been causing him some health problems (I won't get into that) and because it is a night job
which is just hard for living…he has already found another job that he can take, but that job will
make him work every Sunday and prevent him from coming to church…we counseled him to hold off on
that and…pray to God and look for a job that will allow him to keep the Sabbath holy and come to
church, and he said he will do that. He…has a strong desire to come to church and to meet with us
and learn about God and Jesus Christ. We met with him before Ray-choro transferred, and…he shed some
tears and said something about how we keep leaving…he asked me if I was going to have to leave too.
He said that Elder House and Elder Ray and I have helped him so much to understand about God. Please
pray for him so that he can find a good job and continue to come to church and progress toward his
baptismal goal. Ken and Rika are doing great, too. We taught them about baptism after teaching about
faith and repentance, and they said that they will be baptized! We met the mom for the first time
last week, just for a bit. Please pray that we can teach them together as a family. Those are the
main updates for our investigators. Other than that, it has been interesting training a new zone
leader again as well as living with a Brazilian and a new missionary. Elder Mergist has…good ideas
for helping the missionaries and investigators in Osaka…I have high hopes for this transfer. Over
the next several weeks, I wrote the following messages to my family: It has been a…great week in
Abeno! We saw a lot of miracles yesterday (Sunday)… For one, we met with Peter again and taught him
the Word of Wisdom. It was a good lesson because the Spirit was there, and we also had a great
member to participate in the lesson with us. The Word of Wisdom was Peter's main concern about
baptism the last time we met with him, because he drinks coffee and tea regularly and also smokes
and drinks. But we read out of the scriptures with him and testified to him, and he wants to live
the Word of Wisdom! So he committed… It was very powerful because the member that sat in on the
lesson was able to share his personal experience with living the Word of Wisdom and also to
emphasize the importance of faith. So Peter is working towards baptism… We also had two people show
up out of the blue to church that became new investigators after having a lesson! The Lord will
guide us to them, or he will guide them to us. That is one of the biggest reasons that I feel like
our will and the Lord's will are lining up, and as that happens we will be blessed with miracles. We
have four missionaries in Abeno now, and each companionship had three investigators at church on
Sunday for a total of six, so that was awesome. One of the surprise people that came to church is
[Takahashi]; he is having difficulties in his life and remembered having met the missionaries two
years ago in Okayama. Now he lives in Osaka, and he searched for the church and just happened to
come at the one time during the week that it is open and we are there along with all of the members.
We'll be meeting him again next week at the church. This last week was full of miracles! I wish I
could tell you all about them now…here is the short version. We met with Peter again; he is living
the Word of Wisdom and is very happy…he sent me an email the other day apologizing because he hadn't
read the Book of Mormon the previous day and even that was…cool!! because he shared that he had been
really tired at night but still took out the Book of Mormon to read it… then fell asleep before
starting to read, but woke up the next morning in the same position still holding the Book…he
thought that was…cool haha. Also the guy that we met last week at church, [Takahashi], didn't show
up to church/our appointment yesterday… so I was bummed out, but then we got a call last night from
his wife!…we didn't know who it was at first. The call went to my companion's phone… he answered and
started talking, and then his face assumed a look of utter confusion for about 15 seconds, and then
he said something to the effect of, I'm going to let you talk to my companion, and handed me the
phone. The lady on the other end was using the most humble and polite Japanese that I've ever heard…
in Japanese, polite language is kind of a different language than normal language, and her language
was so over-the-top polite and humble that it was pretty difficult to understand!… I pieced together
what she was saying; she apologized that her husband hadn't come, and she explained that he had had
to work overtime without advance notice. The reason that her language was so polite was [probably
that]…last week…Takahashi-san was in a bit of trouble, in that he didn't have food at the time (…he
didn't ask for food though), so we gathered some food for him. And he took it home and ate it with
his wife… The Takahashis are very humble and prepared to hear the message that we share… So we're
going to meet with them together this week! Our other investigators are all doing great. Rika (eight
years old) said one of the best prayers I've ever heard the other day. She and her dad both want to
be baptized…we'll be meeting them again tomorrow, hopefully. The other day, we met with Peter at his
apartment for the first time instead of at the church…we watched Jesus the Christ with him to deepen
his understanding of the Savior… [Of his own accord,] he said he will watch it again this week on
his own… The last seven days have possibly been even more full of miracles than the previous week.
Peter wasn't able to meet, but he sent me an email saying that he had quit coffee and tea, and that
quitting smoking is harder than he thought it would be but it's okay, I can do it!! …of course he
can. Brother Seno in Imabari was smoking 50 cigarettes a day before he met with us, and he stopped
within three weeks. By the way, the Senos and Sister Nishi are doing well in Imabari… they are still
strong, maybe the strongest members of the branch… we're planning to meet with Peter again on
Wednesday… Ken has been too busy to meet with us the last couple weeks, but he sent Rika to the
church to meet with us anyway, and on Tuesday we received permission from Ken to set a baptismal
date with Rika! We taught her more about baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and she set a
baptismal goal. Then she said, Well, my mom won't come to the church… And my dad has to work… So I
will just come by myself! … Sure enough, Rika came to church by herself on Sunday. She lives
decently close to the church so she just rode her bicycle. We were going to have Sister Teraoka sit
by her because [they get along really well] ([Sister Teraoka] sits in on our lessons with Ken and
Rika most of the time), but Sister Teraoka couldn't make it to sacrament meeting, so [Rika] sat with
us. I gave a talk in sacrament meeting about the Book of Mormon, and when I left the stand to go sit
down again she gave me a…wide-eyed look…it was pretty funny. I am going to write a letter to Rika's
mother to persuade her to meet with us. I started it this morning. Ken and Rika both want to be
baptized, but it is difficult without the mom, and Rika also cannot be baptized without written
parental permission (her dad can sign, but…). We've tried working on the mom through Ken and Rika,
but that's difficult because Rika's parents' relationship isn't the best right now. Please pray for
us and for Rika's mom so that we can finally start meeting with them as a family. Also, Tanaka-san
came to church again! He has been an investigator for about 45 years… he hadn't attended church in a
long time until recently, but I felt a couple weeks ago like sending him a message about God's love
and inviting him to church, and he came! Then we had a lesson last week that really clicked with
him, and I felt that I should send him another special message a couple days ago, so I did, and he
came to church again! And he just looked a lot happier. I think he might…be progressing again for
the first time in a…long time. We've had no less that four less-active members call us saying that
they want to start coming back to church and want help. We're working on coordinating that so that
we can have involvement from active members. A couple days ago, we were biking along as a foursome
on our way back from a service project, and I crossed some train tracks on accident (even though one
of the other elders called out that we were going to be turning there)… a train went though, so we
waited for the train to pass by and the guards to lift up so that I could cross back to the other
side. Right as I was going to start biking away, someone called out to me, asking if I was a
missionary. That was [Chiyoda-san], and yesterday he set a date to be baptized! He met with
missionaries in the past and learned just about everything, and he has faith. He just needs to stop
drinking coffee and smoking. Today is Preparation Day, but we have several lessons scheduled. Things
are…taking off in this area!… Ken and Rika are the best, I love them. I finished writing the letter
for Rika's mother but won't be able to give it to Rika until tomorrow because she wasn't able to
come to church yesterday. Yesterday was Stake Conference! And Abeno is the stake center, so the
building was packed with several hundred members, and that was pretty cool. There were some…good
talks from Elder Nakatsuka of the 70, a youth speaker, and President Zinke (our mission president).
Did I tell y'all that Rika speaks fluent English and is a child actress? We help her to speak good
English for her performances, and every couple weeks she goes to Tokyo. And she loves Jesus Christ
and will be baptized. [We] just need to get through to her mom. And Ken needs to get Sundays off so
that he can come to church. We're finally meeting with Peter again today, so that's exciting. He's
been trying hard to follow the Word of Wisdom and is making a lot of progress. We'll probably move
his baptismal goal back some so that we have more time to finish teaching him the rest of the
commandments, though. Tons of new people! All the time! People just walk into the church or call us
and want to learn! Changing missionary work in order to have the churches open more often was true
revelation… we're emphasizing that here. We have also just had many opportunities to serve people
and to interact with people in more natural and fun ways than housing and streeting, which is…great…
Although I emphasized miracles and good experiences in my emails home, missionary work was not
without difficulties. Neither was my companionship with Elder Mergist, unfortunately. Although I
really liked Elder Mergist, I began to notice some serious problems, and about halfway through our
time together (we were companions for two transfers), I wrote the following to my mission president:
This week was really good in some ways… As far as yakusokusha and progressing investigators (which
I'm in charge of for Abeno) are concerned, this was a…good week. We met with Peter three times this
last week; on Monday we taught him the Law of the Fast, on Saturday a member (a Sekime member
actually) took us all out to yakiniku [Korean barbeque] (the best yakiniku I've ever had…), and on
Sunday we taught him tithing, the law of chastity, and law of the land. We've been teaching him
everything 2GS, and he is doing…well. As soon as we start testifying, he just gets…excited to live
the commandments! So Peter is awesome. Also, we met with Ken and Rika on Tuesday, and they said that
they are finally going over to have us over to their house as soon as Shiyori-shimai (their member
fellowshipper) gets back from her trip to America on the 11th! …Rika's mom is actually the one who
suggested it! Her heart has been softening because we've been helping Rika so much… maybe the letter
that I wrote to her had something to do with it too… this is key because Rika can be baptized in a
couple weeks if her mom is on board (and I know she will be if we can meet with her and teach them
together), and then Rika's parents can progress together and get baptized too. We're still meeting
with Katou-shimai and the Fujimotos regularly and have started meeting again with a…good
investigator named Naoki who is solid and wants to be baptized. The bad part of this week was that
no new investigators were found and no one came to church (Rika and two other investigators that
have a lot of potential were confirmed to come, but all of them ended up not being able to…[perhaps
because of the rain]). Mergist-choro got pretty depressed at church when no one showed up, so I
tried to help him to keep his spirits up…but not to much avail. Sometimes bad things and rainy days
happen and we just have to press forward and cause things to improve. [Like Elder Mergist,] I was
really disappointed that no one came; even aside from the fact that…our investigators woud not come
unto Christ through attending sacrament meeting, it meant that we woud not hit the Standards
[standards of excellence]. But I was disappointed with the way that Mergist-choro reacted… he
basically didn't pay attention or participate for the rest of church, especially 3rd hour, just kind
of looked unhappy or played with his tie like a child, and the members were noticing. On a more
positive note, ZTM [zone training meeting] on Friday went…well. I felt like we were…able to address
the needs of the zone and to instill a desire in everyone to get moving on some things and to gather
the elect. The discussion and review of the training plan was fruitful; Mergist-choro gave
a…motivating training about OYM; the OYM presentations that we requested from zone members went…well
(Casper-choro's Japanese is [really good] for 6th transfer, and…Hayashi-choro's demonstration level
prayer in English was way good); we also trained about church attendance, I gave a training about
loving our investigators, and Mergist-choro trained about the 3 pillars and 4 questions. All in all,
[ZTM] went well, and we're seeing significant improvement in the zone! The Nabari district is
finding investigators (basically building teaching pools from scratch at the moment) —
Yamatokoriyama found two new investigators yesterday! Nara has a new yakusokusha, and Nabari has
been finding new investigators as well. Hirakata2 has created seven new yakusokusha in the last
three days… Habikino is moving a little slower; as Yoshida-choro has been there they've been
improving the Habikino area little by little over the last couple transfers, but Mergist-choro and I
think that there may be a bit of a stigma that they'll need to overcome before things…start moving.
But then there's the Higashi Osaka situation [not good]… Also, a transfer passed and Abeno2
hasn't…been able to build a teaching pool yet. I'm kind of [disappointed] with Abeno2 and even with
my companion to an extent. I love Fernandes-choro and I've been trying to make sure that I love
Spilker-choro, but their behavior sometimes is…disappointing, especially Spilker-choro's. He
basically is still a child (a child who hasn't been disciplined properly)… he hasn't figured out yet
what it means to be a man or a representative of Jesus Christ, so sometimes his behavior is
inappropriate and he shows a lack of respect to the people around him. I had a…good talk with him
two or three weeks ago — I took him to Gust [a restaurant] and dropped a little over 3000 yen
[approx. $30] on lunch for the two of us, then walked back to the church with him and [sat down],
started with a prayer and discussed some things, and it was…good and constructive… he recognized the
errors of his ways, especially in some particular things, but recently things are still slipping.
Sometimes I feel like I don't want him to be near my investigators in case he does or says something
inappropriate… I feel the same way about the members, but [there's no helping that] because we all
go to church together every week. The other thing I'm [concerned] about is lack of diligence. I feel
like I am trying…hard to always be using my time effectively, but I feel like I'm doing that alone —
especially when we are in the apartment. I email investigators and potential investigators, I study
Japanese diligently, I clean, etc., and I never lay down to sleep or rest until 10:30. Then I get up
at 5:30 unless I am too tired, in which case I'm up at 6:29 and get out of my futon. Everyone else
wastes time, including my companion, and I feel like that has damaged our credibility as zone
leaders to an extent. [Elder Mergist and I should] be at the Standards, but we aren't. Mergist-choro
is in charge of new investigators and church attendance, but it seems like I have to follow up with
him constantly or he won't contact our potential investigators because he likes to do other things
like rest or talk with Fernandes-choro and Spilker-choro while we're in the apartment. It ends up
not really being split responsibility… new investigators and church attendance clearly are suffering
(I wonder when he'll connect the dots; he doesn't seem to agree with my thoughts about diligence).
Also, his Japanese honestly is pretty poor, but he doesn't put the effort in and set an example of
diligent study for the other companionship living with us. Also… I have to make sure that everyone
gets up in the morning, even though I'm not the only one with an alarm. Fernandes-choro almost
always gets up on his own, but after 6:30 passes I usually have to go into the tatami room and open
up all the sliding doors, hit the light on, and get my companion up. And then he doesn't exercise. I
love Mergist-choro… so I'm not just ragging on him, but I need some help. We are so close!! And
there absolutely will be baptisms this transfer. But I feel that as we do what the Lord asks of us,
we can perform so many more miracles than we are currently. That's what I want to happen… Over the
next few weeks, I wrote the following emails to my family: This week was so good! Katou-san
committed to read the scriptures daily, and then yesterday she came to church for the first time and
had an awesome experience. On Saturday when we met with her, she didn't say for sure that she would
attend church…but then she showed up Sunday morning and said that she felt like coming to church was
the right thing to do. At the end of Sunday school, she cried because the message that was shared
(about developing our talents in order to serve others, incidentally) …touched her… She made some
friends and stayed for all three hours, and I expect that she will come to church every week from
now on. She felt the Spirit a lot, and she loved it. We scheduled her baptismal date for late
October, but it's looking like she'll be ready sooner. Rika is doing good, and we should be able to
meet with her family this week. That will decide whether or not she can be baptized on the 29th of
this month. Fujiwara-san called us last week and said that she wants to get baptized as soon as
possible. She removed her registration with her maiden family's Buddhist religion, and we have
started teaching her about the commandments. She committed to come to church every week in order to
prepare to be baptized, but then, irony of ironies, we helped take her to a job interview (she
didn't know for sure how to get there), and she passed the interview and now has to work on Sundays!
So now we are working on helping her to figure out a way to have her schedule changed so that she
can keep the Sabbath Day holy and attend church. She was very happy that she passed the interview,
though; she's been going to job interviews pretty much every day for the last few weeks and nothing
has come of it, but then she passed this one when we went with her, so it actually sparked a
conversation in which we had to explain that we are not wizards. She wanted us to do some more
sorcery in order to land her in a second job. We taught Peter a special lesson about the Atonement
and the Sacrament in order to help him to understand the importance of attending church on Sundays,
and he really wants to attend church weekly now. He has actually …wanted to go to church this whole
time, but now it's on his mind again, and we made a plan. He intends to move to Kobe next month. So
he is going to quit his current job early, come to church and be baptized on the 6th of October, and
then move to Kobe the week after and continue to attend church there, where his new job will allow
him to have Sundays off. Peter's faith has grown so much since we first started meeting with him — I
remember back when we first invited him to follow Jesus Christ and be baptized, and he said that he
didn't know if he would be able to because he liked coffee and smoking, but that he would try. But
by the time we introduced the law of chastity and the law of tithing, he didn't even hesitate.
During our last lesson him, he bore his testimony to us of the truth and blessings of the Gospel
without even being asked. The work rolls forth. Well this week was one of the best weeks ever!! We
had lots of lessons, more than I've had in a long time. Yesterday, we were basically at the church
the whole day… we had church until 1:00, then we went home and ate lunch…quickly, and then we went
back to the church and taught lessons until 8:30. Katou-san has continued to meet with us regularly.
We met with her several times this week, including during a companion exchange with the APs on
Wedneday. She's progressing…well, and she's been really touched by the church. Every time we meet,
she tells us how she has been saved through this church. There's a McDonald's (in Japanese,
makudonarudo , or makudo for short) close to the church, and this last week was buy one Big Mac get
one free…so we walked there with her after our lesson on Wednesday, and I got 4 Big Macs (only cost
about $8) and gave her one… It was a…small thing, but she seemed…touched and I was surprised… she
knows that we're 20-year-old volunteers living off of saved money, though. Yesterday, we talked with
her about the Book of Mormon because she hasn't…started into it yet, and she committed again to read
the Book of Mormon daily. Peter is going to be baptized this next Sunday!! We met him yesterday, and
he told us he had good and bad news. I just told you the good news; the bad news (for us) is, he'll
be moving to Kobe just a couple days after that. His current job will end on Wednesday, he will come
to church and be baptized on Sunday, and then he will move to Kobe at the beginning of October and
start his new job there. But he will continue to go to church there and take the Sacrament every
week. Peter's the man!… because my companion and I were on a companion exchange with the APs (who
work in Kobe) on Wednesday, I had the chance to go visit Peter that evening and introduce him to
Elder Carver so that he will know him when he starts going to church in Kobe. Rika came to the
church to meet with us last night (she's the 9-year-old who is…smart and speaks fluent English), and
we taught her about the Atonement of Jesus Christ and about the ordinance of the Sacrament… We also
reset Rika's baptismal date with her for the 12th of October, because she needs to come to Sacrament
meeting a couple more times before getting baptized. She understood the Sacrament lesson…well and
wants to come to church every week from now on. We're going over to Rika's home (the [Adachi]
family - just her and her mom and dad) on Thursday for dinner. We've been waiting for that for a
while now, and we finally have the day set!! That will be our opportunity to touch Rika's mom's
heart and secure her approval for Rika to be baptized. Also for Legstand-san to continue meeting
with us, together with her family. Mergist-choro and I traveled to Hirakata on Saturday so that I
could do the baptismal interview for Tanishige-kyodai there. He will also be baptized this upcoming
Sunday ( : …with these investigators and with our teaching opportunities in general this last week,
I was…struck by the power of heart-felt testimony and of the Spirit. The work rolls forth. Peter's
pre-baptism photo Peter was baptized! He was really happy… He bore a great testimony to the ward
after [being baptized]. He told everyone the story of how he came into contact with the church and
with missionaries, and how he has come to understand about God as our Heavenly Father. He also said
that he knows that as he moves forward and faces challenges that he can pray and receive the
strength and courage to press on. I know that Peter will be a strength to the members in Kobe when
he moves there. This was…a really awesome week… we were…busy the whole week, and everything fell
into place as we worked. Our investigators are doing …well, and we found several new investigators
as well. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is changing these people's lives. Also, we met with the [Adachi]
family on Thursday as planned, and we were finally able to teach them all together — Rika and her
parents. It was a …good lesson, and I think Rika's mom was touched… however, [she] didn't give her
permission for Rika to be baptized. She didn't say yes or no, actually… we invited them to pray
about it together, and we're going to continue to do everything we can for them. It seems that we'll
be able to continue meeting with them together as a family, and I'm confident that Rika will be
baptized. Her parents, too. I love the [Adachis], and our other investigators. It's [an] awesome
opportunity to be here serving these people and helping them to come unto Christ, full time. My
final week in Abeno, after receiving transfer calls, I wrote the following email to my family: I am
transferring to Higashi Osaka! I am sad and excited at the same time. I…love the investigators here
in Abeno, but I can stay in contact with them, and also… Higashi Osaka is the same district at Abeno
(it's actually super close distance-wise… I could bike to my new area in twenty minutes), and I will
be the district leader (I will also be training a new missionary for the first time), which means
that I will be able to continue to be involved in the progression of the investigators in Abeno,
perform their baptismal interviews, and attend their baptisms. In other news, this last week has
been…really good! Peter moved, and he attended church in Sumoto for the first time yesterday and had
a great experience, so he's…happy… and grateful to God. He sent me a long email about it yesterday
evening ( : We taught Rika the Ten Commandments, and she understood them incredibly well. I was just
amazed during that lesson because we were reading in English and this 9-year-old Japanese girl could
read all of the scriptures with only the smallest bit of help (we explained that thy means your),
and she understood exactly how each commandment applied to her and asked lots of…good questions. She
has gained such great faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Her mom came to pick her up at the
church, so we were able to talk more, and I think Legstand-san's heart will continue to soften as
she sees the kind of influence the Gospel is in her daughter's life. I think Rika could be baptized
this next transfer, and I would be so happy to come do her baptismal interview and see her baptism.
Our other investigators are also doing well. Katou-san still doesn't understand the full
significance of the Restoration, and that this is the one true and living church, but she brought
her Chinese friend Chin Byou to church on Sunday and it was a…good experience for both of them. The
last couple transfers have been… probably life-changing. My first transfer in Abeno was tough, but
these last two transfers I woud not trade for anything. We've seen so many miracles, and the
teaching pool here has improved so much. I've…enjoyed working with Mergist-choro, and also
Fernandes-choro and Spilker-choro. Spilker-choro will be transferring out to Tsuyama on the western
half of the mission, but Mergist-choro will stay here as zone leader…and Fernandes-choro will stay
too, so I will see them on Fridays at district meetings. Higashi Osaka has been a sisters area until
now…and from now on it will be an elders and sisters area… my new companion and I will be somewhat
starting from scratch with no investigators (unless the sisters refer some investigators to us),
which will also be interesting… This is my district! We took this picture last Friday after district
meeting. The ones who will still be here next transfer are… me, Rowlings-choro (top left),
Fernandes-choro (bottom middle), Mergist-choro (bottom right), and Dean-shimai and Douglas-shimai
(on the far right, serving in Higashi Osaka). To my left is Yoshida-choro, Habikino's district
leader until now; in the bottom left is Spilker-choro, who has been Fernandes-choro's companion here
in Abeno; and to my right is DeKlerk-shimai, who is transferring to Hashimoto.

Mission: Higashi Osaka (Transfers 12 – 16)

My first week in Higashi Osaka, I wrote the following to my mission president: …We've had packages
arriving pretty steadily, and the apartment is mostly set up now, and we also have a big stack of
referrals from the sisters to get to work on. Elder Carlile is awesome, I think he'll grow up to be
a…good missionary and a leader. I don't know what I'm doing as a trainer… but Elder Carlile seems
solid… Also, the members are great. It was weird because our first Sunday [of the transfer], we were
back in Abeno to watch General Conference [rather than in Higashi Osaka for sacrament meeting as
usual], so I was able to say good-bye to the Abeno members, and I met a few of the Higashi Osaka
members and pulled some OYM on the bishop. It seems that the ward has really been waiting to get
some elders… there is a lot of potential… Other than that, not much to report at this point. Over
the next several weeks, I wrote the following emails to my family: Higashi Osaka is a…wonderful
area! And it is so close to [Abeno]!… Our new apartment is actually within the eastern border of
Osaka City, but it's included in the Higashi Osaka ward boundaries. Last week, we had to put quite a
bit of time into getting the apartment set up (putting together desks and dressers, etc. that
arrived in packages throughout the week), getting new bikes, etc., but we were also able to get in
contact with and schedule appointments with several people from the area book, and we had a
couple…cool miracles already. The reason we didn't move into the sisters' old apartment…is that they
are still here. [There are] two sisters and two elders in Higashi Osaka now. The sisters are Sister
Dean and Sister Douglas, who are on their 4th and 3rd transfers, respectively. President Zinke
apparently called them during transfers and told them to use me to learn Japanese, haha. …the
coolest things that happened this last week are probably… I was calling lots of people out of the
area book (the sisters gave us a lot of old teaching records for male investigators or other
investigators that they had tried unsuccessfully to contact), and I called a Kobayashi-san who is a
mother of five and had studied English and the Gospel with missionaries for several months in the
past. The sisters had actually just called her a couple weeks previous to this, but she told them
that she didn't have interest. I called her, and for some reason she decided to talk with me, and
even though she expressed that she did not want to talk about religion, we were able to schedule a
time to meet later in the week at a park nearby her home (with all her kids too)… we had a…good talk
with her, established some trust, and testified about the importance of families… But most
important, I think the Spirit testified to her. It was so awesome. We invited her to meet with us
weekly to learn English for 30 minutes and hear a Gospel message for 30 minutes, and she agreed! We
also scheduled appointments with several other former investigators… …we met a 19-year-old Kouki-kun
at a drug store who is going to home stay in America next year (guess where… Utah)!… he wants to
start meeting with us and practice speaking English… so we're going to eat dinner with him tomorrow
night and have a talk that could change his life… …we also met with a man named Yasufuku and
scheduled an appointment to meet this Wednesday because he wants to hear our entire message even if
it takes 6 hours! When I wrote home, I made our encounter with Yasufuku-san seem to be an entirely
positive experience, but in reality, he had been mildly antagonistic or challenging toward us. When
we asked him for a return appointment, he challenged us to share our message in its entirety right
then, and when he told him that it might take a number of hours and that we did not have the time
that day, we settled upon meeting on Wednesday for however long it would take. My companion, Elder
Carlile, is from Boston, Massachusetts. We're exactly the same height pretty much, if we take off
shoes then I'm about a millimeter taller… he's…cool! It's been fun working together this last week,
and interesting because it was his first full week in Japan. Lots of new experiences. Not too much
to update this week… it was super busy, but it feels like little of the time was spent in my own
area! I traveled to Habikino (45 minutes away by train) another two times this week… The office
called and asked me to go there on Tuesday in order to inspect new apartments that they are
considering purchasing in order to put additional missionaries in Habikino next transfer, which took
most of the day, and then I traveled there again after district meeting on Friday to do a
companionship exchange with the Habikino elders which lasted until Saturday afternoon. I did Brother
Imura's baptismal interview for the second time on Saturday night, and he passed! He did some
serious reflection and revelation seeking after our last interview, and he had a really awesome
spiritual experience that solidified his testimony and confidence. He is getting baptized tonight in
Habikino. ( : Unfortunately Yasufuku [the guy who said he wants to hear all of our message in one
sitting even if it takes six hours] wasn't able to meet on Wednesday… we hope to meet with him this
week instead. Yasufuku stood us up, and we were unable to regain contact with him. Kouki-kun (the
19-year-old who will home stay in Utah next year) took us out to dinner on Tuesday… and his friend
Masakazu! That was really cool… they both want to meet again and bring another friend. We haven't
bridged to the Gospel yet…but we hope to do so the next time that we meet (this Wednesday). We were
desperate to build an investigator pool, and I did not want to drive Kouki away by pushing the
Gospel too quickly. Elder Carlile and I hoped to bridge to the Gospel while continuing to build
trust with Kouki-kun by helping him with his English. A typhoon prevented us from meeting with the
Kobayashi family this last week, but we hope to meet with them this week, and it seems from the
communication that I've had with the mom that they have every intention of meeting with us! We met
Hari at his Indian restaurant on Thursday, and he [said he] will meet with us every…Thursday from
now on! Hari did say that, but unfortunately, that is not how things worked out. We tried to meet
with him each week, but the couple lessons that we were actually able to have with him could barely
be considered real lessons. Hari may have simply wanted us to continue dropping by his restaurant so
that we would eat there more often (incidentally, the food was delicious). Or perhaps he just was
trying to be polite, or perhaps he simply changed his mind. It was really cool to talk with
[Hari]…he already believes in God and Jesus Christ and feels that Christianity is the best way of
living… he has the desire to learn and apply Christ's teachings in his life. We will teach him using
a Nepali Book of Mormon if we can get our hands on one. I love y'all a lot… There is something a
little strange about telling people that I only have 6 months left as a (full-time) missionary. I'm
an old missionary! My body is tired, I have lots of stories to tell, and I'm looked up to for my
experience and wisdom by younger missionaries even though it doesn't seem so long ago that I was in
their position… This week, lots of cool experiences… We gave Hari [our Nepali investigator] his new
Hindi Book of Mormon, and we'll visit him tomorrow to do a lesson. Hari works at the best Indian
restaurant that I've found in Japan. My companion and I ate there for the first time last week, and
it was incredible… and we had got special service because the hostess/waitress is a Filipino woman
who is actually one of the sister missionaries' investigators. We met with Kobayashi-san and her
family at the park again! She has some of the cutest kids I've ever seen. We got to teach them all
some English and do a short Gospel lesson for the first time. We will continue meeting them every
Friday, but from now on it will be in their home. ( : Also, a new investigator named Shin'ichi came
to Eikaiwa on Wednesday night and had a lesson afterward! We taught him about prayer, and he was way
receptive. He is currently trying to find a job, so he's…busy but scheduled another meeting for next
Friday. Then, while we were biking around the other day, we ran into Yamasaki-san and her kids! We
were riding by and I heard her say in English, Hey, it's the missionaries! so we turned around and
talked with her. Turns out that she homestayed in Utah when she was younger, and she is a friend to
the missionaries. She was…interested in having us teach English to her and her kids, and she said
that she's not really interested in the Gospel but that it's been a long time and she's willing to
listen again. So we scheduled a meeting a couple weeks out. And we met with…a former investigator
[who] loves Jesus Christ but just has some health issues… he almost got baptized before… He's…funny.
We should be able to meet with him every week from now on! And a…cool thing happened at church
yesterday… a Japanese woman named Kumi came to church with her French boyfriend, Davido. They're…
…cool people, we and the sister missionaries talked with them for a long time after Sacrament
meeting. [Then] we split and Kumi went off with the sisters to Relief Society and Davido came with
us to priesthood meeting. Brother Fujimoto stepped up and was way friendly to him and invited him
and us over to his house in a couple weeks for dinner. Very cool. We and the sister missionaries
will go meet with Kumi and Davido on Wednesday… …I'm finally learning what member missionary work is
all about. Because for the first time in my mission, we're actually working with member referrals!
And it is amazing… I'm glad that Elder Carlile is having this experience at the beginning of his
mission. By this point in my mission, I knew well that streeting and housing, missionaries' two
primary methods of finding new investigators, were quite ineffective from a statistical perspective.
I also knew how much good fellowshippers could assist in investigators's progression. My dream was
for members to truly participate in missionary work and refer their friends and family members so
that we, as missionaries, could spend more time teaching and less time trying to persuade strangers
to meet with us and learn about our religion. In Higashi Osaka, I finally got a brief taste of that
dream. We will begin teaching Sister Nagatani's friend Santos (he is Brazilian) this week. I'm
excited for that… Elder Fernandes taught me how to say a prayer in Portuguese while we were living
in Abeno together. We're also working with Genki-kun, Oyama-san, and a couple other new referrals…
It really is the best way. Member involvement in teaching and the relationships members have with
the people that we teach [can be so powerful]. …we taught Hari about prayer this week! He was super
tired and probably a little hung over when we taught him…so we kept it short… he told us he has been
praying every day since then, so he is progressing! Sister Fujimoto in Abeno was baptized on Sunday!
And Elder Carlile and I were able to attend! I thought that we might not be able to attend, but then
we were teaching Tsukishita-san on Saturday night, and he said he wanted to see a baptism… we
brought him with us on Sunday, and it was a…good experience. The bishop of the Abeno ward did not
seem to be too excited about presiding over Sister Fujimoto's baptismal service, and I could
empathize with him. Sister Fujimoto was the mentally handicapped wife of a mentally handicapped
less-active member. With her mental state, whether or not she even could be considered to require
baptism from a doctrinal/salvation standpoint is questionable. She was a simple target for
missionaries for whom baptism was the primary objective, but she was not someone that could be a
strength to the ward or that could even be expected to continue attending church. We received
transfer calls this morning, and Elder Carlile and I will be staying together here in Higashi Osaka.
Which is what I expected [since we are in the middle of training], but still a relief!… This last
week was the best week of the transfer…what better way to end a transfer! …on Sunday, there were
nine non-members at church. We brought six, and the sisters brought three. Kumi and Davido, Santos
and his son Alan, Sakura-san and her son Makoto, Carmen, Rebekka, and Suwa-san… they are all so
awesome. Their lives are changing. …we met with Brother Tsukishita again after he came to Sister
Fujimoto's baptism last week, and he is seriously thinking about being baptized! He said that his
studies have a much more serious feel to them now that he's regularly meeting with two foreigners
(there had been Japanese sisters in Higashi Osaka for a pretty long time before we got here). When
we met with him Saturday night, he had read and marked up the passage we gave him to read in the
Book of Mormon, and he had some questions about the nature and consequences of baptism. He seemed
pretty relieved when he learned that it would still be ok for him to watch TV even if he receives
baptism! At the beginning of this week, we were concerned about Kobayashi-san because the last time
we taught her it was pretty clear that she didn't have much interest in religion and wasn't terribly
receptive to what we taught. To be honest, I felt a little guilty toward Kobayashi-san. I wondered
if I had not in a way tricked her into meeting us for lessons, since I had scheduled our first
meeting by telling her that we would just get to know her and do an English lesson but had then
proceeded to bridge to our Gospel message. She could have simply said no at that point, of course,
but I wondered if she had only accepted to continue meeting because she did not have the heart to
cut us off after we had begun to establish a relationship. I hoped that she did not resent me or
feel that I had deceived her, and I hoped that she and her family could progress. …we invited her to
just pray once on her own before we meet again… she couldn't remember how to pray, so I wrote down
for her how to say a prayer… At the beginning of this week, we were thinking about what we could do
to help her, and we decided to make a nice prayer card for her — a card that simply lays out how to
say a prayer, nicer than the piece of paper that I wrote on for her in our last lesson. So we did
that. [I carefully wrote out the steps of prayer on a card in beautiful Japanese, and] Elder Carlile
is an artist, so [he drew] a good picture of a woman praying and colored it. We slaved over this
prayer card… and it was frustrating because we weren't satisfied with the first couple attempts and
didn't think it would take so much time, and then at last we had one that was satisfactory. On
Friday, I started a companionship exchange with the Habikino elders following district meeting…
later that day, Elder Carlile traveled out with Elder Rowlings to where Kobayashi-san lives and gave
her the card. From what I heard, she was touched and responded …well — she was…surprised that the
missionaries would ride all the way out to her home (about 40 minutes away) just to give her
something and not to teach a lesson. And her kids were…excited to see the missionaries. I hope that
she prays. We have made good friends with a bike shop owner near the church… last Monday night we
went to visit him, and we started talking with a woman who was with her son getting a flat fixed.
That was Sakura-san! And Sakura-san felt that it was [go-en] (fate) that we met there. She had seen
the sister missionaries earlier that day in the grocery store and felt some kind of impression, and
then she met us at the bike shop and had the same feeling. She gave us her phone number and address
without us even asking, and she told us that she wanted to go with her son to our free English class
and to church… they weren't able to come to the English class last week, but they came to church
yesterday… it was…great! That whole experience…was a testimony to me that the Lord is guiding us and
them [the missionaries and the sheep]… This last week was one of the most incredible weeks of my
mission. There was so many times that I just got off the phone and started yelling and running
around because it was so exciting. I may have frightened my companion a couple times. I'll start
with the Sakura miracle. Last week, I wrote about how we met Sakura-san… We made friends with a bike
shop owner near the church and made sure to stop by there regularly, and we met Sakura-san there
with her 8-year-old son Makoto one evening. She came to church with her son a few days later, and
then to Eikaiwa, and we taught her for the first time on Friday! She explained to us all about the
trials that she has been going through in her life. Her husband is working abroad in Myanmar, she
feels alone, and she has developed uterine cancer. Her little son had been taking her to different
Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines to try to help her feel some peace. And at the hardest time,
when she felt like she had lost all of her energy, she met us. She saw the sister missionaries
buying groceries, and they stood out like there was a sort of light around them. She saw their name
badges, too. Then she met us at the bike shop and recognized that we were the same. When we started
talking to her, she readily promised to come to church and meet again, and she gave us her phone
number and address without being asked. On Sunday, she came to church with Makoto, and they loved
it.

She said that although she didn't understand everything, she felt like it filled her with power and
was right. We taught her simply about her relationship with God, introduced some other concepts, and
set expectations, and she was incredibly receptive. Wonderful lesson and experience. We talked for a
while afterward, and I let slip that my birthday would be on Sunday… she and Makoto showed up to
church yesterday with a birthday cake. They understand just about nothing about the Gospel, but
they've felt it and will continue meeting with us… Also, Kobayashi-san [seems to have been]…impacted
by the prayer card we made for her. She has prayed at least twice, and those were apparently the
first two times in her life that she has prayed on her own… …she said that she felt peaceful when
she prayed, and it was a good feeling. We can work with that. We also dropped off banana chocolate
chip bread (…special form of missionary work that my mother taught me) and a note, and she sent me a
text later raving about how good the banana bread was and requesting the recipe (レシピ教えて。すぐ
に作りたいの。please! Teach me the recipe, I want to make it immediately! please!)… we'll be meeting
her this week for a lesson. Santos and his boy Alam are so awesome. They came to church again
yesterday. We met with them a few days ago, taught the Restoration and gave him a Book of Mormon in
Portuguese! That lesson was pretty special. We taught him the Restoration… I just plugged Portuguese
words into Japanese grammar the whole time, and it worked…well because he struggles with Japanese
outside of a factory environment and doesn't speak [English]… I'm…glad I had Elder Fernandes in my
apartment back in Abeno! And I am hard core studying Portuguese religious vocabulary for [Santos]
now. Speaking of connections made back while I was in Abeno… A while back, I was in contact through
email off and on for a couple weeks with Sister Fukui, one of the sister's investigators here… I had
found a random email address and had no idea to whom the email address belonged but felt like I
should send an email to it… it turned out to be Fukui, whom I knew about because I was the zone
leader at the time. We emailed back and forth for a couple weeks talking about her situation, and
then I transferred here (which she didn't know about, of course), and on Friday I met her and her
11-year-old daughter because we taught a joint lesson with the sisters. It was actually intended to
be a baptismal interview, but instead we taught a lesson and did not do the baptismal interview. Her
husband is opposed to the church and to baptism (this has been the situation for a long long time)…
Her foundation of faith needs to be strengthened through prayer, reading the Book of Mormon, and
attending church, in order for her to be ready for baptism and again approach her husband. We were
able to help her understand that in the lesson, and she committed herself to do those things… and
then at the end I told her that this wasn't the first time we had talked, and she was so surprised
and it was pretty funny. When I explained, she got… excited and said that it was すごい縁 (amazing
ties/connection/fate)! And as far as Brother Tsukishita… We will set a goal for baptism with him the
next time we meet. His physical condition is bad right now, and so he wasn't able to come to church
yesterday, but my companion and I decided that we'll pay for him to get to church by taxi if need
be. He loves Jesus Christ and wants to follow him, so now he needs the faith that the power will be
given him to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me [Christ] (Moroni 7:33)…including getting to
church a few times so that he can be baptized. He needs our prayers!… This week was so so busy… we
hosted a Thanksgiving party at the church… it was a great success. The 感謝祭 (Thanksgiving party)
was my idea a couple weeks ago… the ward hopped on board right away, but no one knew what to do
since Thanksgiving is not a Japanese holiday. So I put together the program and preparations with my
companion, and the members took responsibility for the Thanksgiving meal. It was great because lots
of investigators came, and it was good fellowshipping… we were able to teach a couple friends for
the first time after the 感謝祭 [Thanksgiving party] ended! But before I get to that — I did a
companionship exchange back into Abeno on Tuesday! Which happens to be the day that Ken and Rika
come to meet the missionaries before the free English class in the evening. Ok, I did that on
purpose. It was so good to be able to see them again. Recently (ever since I left Abeno) they have
been busy and haven't been able to meet with the missionaries for lessons, but when I told him that
I teach the same free English class on Wednesday nights in Higashi Osaka, he got excited and said he
wants to attend with Rika and that his busiest days are actually Thursday, Friday, and the weekend.
So my goal is to get them meeting with missionaries more for lessons again. Rika still wants to be
baptized, and Ken is still praying frequently (but doesn't know as much of our teachings as Rika
because he hasn't been able to meet with us as much), but Rika's mom [still seems to be] an
obstacle… Back to the Thanksgiving party… It was cool because I wasn't sure how we would start
things after the bishop welcomed everyone, but it went smoothly, and we followed a family
Thanksgiving tradition of Sister Dean's by going around the table and having each person say
something for which they are thankful before beginning the meal. Everyone participated and it
brought a nice spirit of gratitude to the whole thing, and then we ate… Then we all went upstairs, I
introduced the pinata and that was fun for a while until the turkey had thoroughly died and the
candy was seized… we did a couple more Thanksgiving-themed games/activities, and then it was…time to
end. …afterwards, we were able to teach a couple friends…for the first time simply about who God is
and what the gospel of Jesus Christ is all about, and that was a…good experience as well. It was
pretty obvious they had never…thought about God before, but they started thinking pretty hard when
we asked them what question they would like to ask God if they could ask him any question. One said
that he would ask if he will be able to become happy in his life, and the other said that he would
ask why he was born on this earth. They said they will meet with us again… we will teach them how to
pray. …on Sunday, we were able to meet with Kumi and Davido and teach them the Restoration and give
Davido a French Book of Mormon and Kumi a Japanese one, and they said they will read and pray! Most
of our investigators were busy or sick last week, but Kumi, Davido, and Kayo-san were able to come
to church on Sunday, as well as three of the sisters' investigators! The members are happy and
getting fired up because of all the investigators that have been coming to church recently. Sister
Iwata, an elderly member who is so awesome, took us walking around the church afterward to introduce
us to a couple neighbors to whom she had given a Book of Mormon… I…love my mission. We had zone
conference on Friday, and I had the chance to listen to a dying (returning) missionary's testimony…
And I…realized how much I love my mission. I know that the church is true… that God is our Father,
Jesus Christ is our Redeemer, and this is where I'm supposed to be, for 5 more months. [The members
have] been…happy recently and getting …fired up about missionary work because investigators have
been swelling church attendance by about 33%. Yesterday there were 10 investigators there… It was
awesome! Rika's mom's obstacle with the gospel appears to be mostly social as far as I can tell… she
doesn't want to be seen as one of those Christians by friends, [or something like that]. I imagine
that could just be the tip of the iceberg, though… Last week we reviewed and explained the
Restoration in more depth to Brother Santos, and it went…well. We invited him to be baptized when he
comes to know that our message is true, and at first he was hesitant…but we explained the nature and
purpose of a baptismal goal and he committed to work towards February 16! He is such a good…man. His
lessons are always interesting. The Spirit…helped me to get through with Japanese and Portuguese as
we taught him… The only thing I'm concerned about at this point is that when we invite him to pray
at the end of our lessons, he is reciting some kind of set Catholic prayer… our next plant is to
teach him…about prayer. We taught Kayo-shimai the Restoration as well and gave her the Book of
Mormon… and we taught the Restoration to Sakura-shimai and gave her a Book of Mormon… Sakura-shimai
was actually the first of them that we taught the Restoration last week, and the lesson honestly
didn't go very well at all from a teaching skills standpoint, but she was incredibly receptive… in
that way, it was a humbling experience for us. Kayo-shimai's lesson went…well, and we had two great
sisters from the Relief Society to sit in on the lesson with us. She has so many questions and a
wonderful desire to know what is true. My companion bore a…solid and simple testimony of the truth
of the Book of Mormon at the end of the lesson that tied things up perfectly. Sakura-shimai brought
two friends with her to church yesterday, Mori-shimai and her daughter, and they are going to keep
coming! They have a Book of Mormon now, too. It has been a…good week! From here, I'm expecting
trials but also miracles. The Lord is on our side. Looking back, my time with Elder Carlile was
quite full of ups and down. We identified so many experiences as miracles only to later be
disappointed but then have other seemingly miraculous experiences. There always seemed to be so much
potential in the investigator pool that we hoped to unleash. At any rate, Elder Carlile and I
continued to do our best and try to meet with and help all of our investigators and potential
investigators. At times, when our investigators did not progress as expected or as hoped, I may have
felt that the Lord was letting me down or that I was letting the Lord down, but I tried to repress
such feelings so that I could give missionary work my best effort. I wanted to gather the sheep, I
wanted to be an example for my district members, and I wanted for Elder Carlile to have an inspiring
beginning to his mission. I wanted to see the Lord's hand in our work. Close to the end of my second
transfer with Elder Carlile, I wrote the following email to my mission president: Dear President
Zinke, … Not the best week, in that we only taught one lesson… It was with Tanaka, our 23-year-old
new investigator. That was actually on last Monday morning… after that, all of our other
investigators got…busy with December stuff for the week… What a week, though: Monday, preparation
day (with three lessons scheduled, although two fell through); Tuesday, trainer trainee training
meeting; Wednesday, companion exchange with the Abeno zone leaders; Thursday, weekly planning
session; Friday, district meeting; Saturday, Rebecca's baptism and the ward Christmas Concert;
Sunday, the Christmas service… The lesson with Tanaka went well. It was Setting the Table. Tanaka is
a pretty interesting guy! Interesting as in different — he is living alone, working, and being
supported somewhat by his parents, and he just seems to be somewhat of a drop out from society. We
went to visit him at his apartment, it was pretty messy, and he was pretty quiet but nice. We got to
know him for a few minutes and started in Setting the Table, and it was the first time I've taught
Setting the Table to a Japanese person and had each question answered Yes ! I wouldn't say he…opened
his heart, but he was pretty receptive and said he would like to continue meeting on his days off
from work. I think Tanaka is…promising, because he is a young guy just looking for his place in the
world. When I talked with Katou-choro about him, Katou-choro recommended spending some time with him
to become his friend and set an example for him outside of lessons. I look forward to seeing how he
changes as he accepts the Gospel… he's one of those people that I would expect to change visibly.
TTT [Trainer Trainee Training] on Tuesday was really good… a lot of…important items were discussed…
SMHPFoL, OYM, etc. My companion asked about Setting the Table because I asked him to [do so]… When I
followed up with the Habikino elders before, there were difficulties with [Setting the Table]… they
were using it …wrong, Williams-choro was opposed to the idea of memorizing, they weren't
[practicing] it at all, etc. He wasn't terribly receptive to my correction at the time, so I think
it…helped to hear about [Setting the Table] directly from you and the assistants. The exchange on
Wednesday [with the zone leaders] was…good, too. I worked with Katou-choro… I have a lot of respect
for him… We had a lot of opportunity to talk about the state of the district and the zone, I heard
his conversion story for the first time, and we were just able to bounce a lot of ideas and opinions
off of each other about various things… I was able to teach an AB lesson to Peter ([whom I baptized]
while I was in Abeno). It just about exploded his brain to see me… no one had told him that I would
be there. It was…funny, and it was…good to see him. We taught him about the Holy Ghost, and
that…helped him because he was able to understand a lot better the workings of the Spirit in his
life; he recognized that he has been feeling the Spirit a lot… Katou-choro and I planned for an
appointment with Masa Koutarou, and then we went to teach that lesson. That was one of the best
experiences I have had with the 2GS teaching model, and particularly I learned more the value of
sharing personal experiences. Koutarou is nine years old and is one of their progressing
investigators; his mom and older sister are members, but his dad is [opposed]. I started teaching
Koutarou while I was in Abeno… he always listens to lessons with his mom and sister… I was happy to
see them, and they were…surprised and happy… Elder Katou and I taught Koutarou a 2GS lesson on God
is our Loving Heavenly Father. He listened so carefully and understood so well, it was amazing. The
30 second statements and heartfelt statements were perfect for him. It was actually after the
message that we were talking with Koutarou's mom to address a concern about a difficulty in the
family with her husband, and Katou-choro whipped out a personal experience that really helped her.
Katou-choro and I talked about that afterward, and it's something that we are focusing on now…
sharing experiences. I was…not prepared for District Meeting on Friday… so although we talked about
a lot of important things, it lacked…spiritual energy… I thought afterward about how to fix that and
ended up sending a follow-up email out to the district that I think helped. This week, I'll make
sure there's adequate preparation. In spite of the difficulties Elder Carlile and I had with meeting
with our investigators last week, I think that maybe some…good things have happened too. On Friday I
was actually planning on doing a companion exchange with the Abeno2 elders following district
meeting, but that was poor planning on my part because I remembered that I would need to be at
Rebecca's baptism the following morning to play the piano and that we also had preparations to do
for the Christmas concert, so I canceled the exchange. Elder Carlile and I prayed to know what we
should do for the rest of the day, and I felt like I should look at our goals and see what efforts
we could make towards our people indicators [key indicators for yakusokusha, church attendance,
progressing investigators, and new investigators]… when I did that, I felt like we should go visit
Kayou-shimai, one of our progressing investigators. Our strongest progressing investigator,
currently. She lives about 45 minutes away by bike… we went to go visit her to share a scriptural
message and ask for referrals, and she answered the door and it was super windy and cold and she was
really surprised to see us. She kept asking why we came today, and looking back I wish I had told
her why! because then she told us about how she had been having an especially rough day and was
getting depressed and then we showed up and made everything better, and she felt like it was God
watching out for her through us. She liked the scripture that we shared (Ether 12:4 about faith in
God), decided to read that chapter for her daily reading, and came to the Christmas concert on
Saturday night but unfortunately had a sudden errand on Sunday that prevented her from coming to
church. She is showing so much promise… she will be a strong member when she converts. The members
recognize that, too; she's getting better fellowshipping than we can usually come by, and the
members enjoy sitting in on our lessons with her. We haven't been able to meet with Santos, our
yakusokusha, for the last two weeks. Yesterday, I realized that although we've been planning to
teach him the prayer lesson, we really aren't prepared to teach that because he won't understand it
unless I prepare the Portuguese for it (he understands and speaks enough Japanese for basic
conversation, just not for the Gospel; my companion can still participate by testifying with simple
Japanese, though… Interestingly, Santos still enjoys church although he can't understand much of
what is being said. I want to help him to improve his Japanese so that he can understand more as he
continues to attend). Then we called him and were finally able to get hold of him, and he said that
this week…is super busy but that maybe he can come to church next week and meet us there. So we are
just going to prepare that lesson really well for him. I am curious about what will happen with
transfers… the [ward mission leader] seems to want Dean-shimai to transfer out (which is not her
fault necessarily; sometimes he can be difficult). Dean-shimai is a…[faithful] missionary… she seems
to only lack in language development. It's pretty bad, but she seems to be kind of prideful in that
area so it's not…improving. The ward contacts me sometimes when they want to communicate with the
sisters. Carlile-choro…loves Higashi Osaka, and… The ward seems to like him. If I transferred, I
would only be concerned because Kayou-shimai is the only investigator that seems to have a
connection with him. Several of our investigators might not be solid enough yet to easily continue
in the teaching process if I transferred… On the other hand, I know that everything will work out if
I follow the will of the Lord. That's what my companion and I will do to make this week a good one.
As always, I am ready to work wherever I am supposed to work. Thank you for always training and
helping us, Zinke-kaicho. The last week of my second transfer with Elder Carlile, I wrote, We got
transfer calls and I'm staying in Higashi Osaka, but Elder Carlile is transferring to Nishiwaki…
He's pretty bummed out about that. Transfers are hard!… every area that I've been to has become my
favorite. That's just how it works. Christmas this year was…special. The Higashi Osaka ward…showered
us with love — I was Santa at the ward Christmas party (just for about 15 minutes thankfully — the
suit was really hot), we had bags of gifts given to us by the members (which [was completely
unexpected]), had a full-out Christmas dinner and program at Brother Irie's home… … As we were going
through the area book throughout this last week, we found lots of people that want to meet with
missionaries again after the New Year! I was…surprised… … the next couple weeks should be
interesting. I am a little concerned about my new companion, though. [My new companion] will be
Elder Broeder, and I've heard nothing but trouble about him (obedience issues, etc.)… Elder Mergist
trained him, so I heard things from him, and then he was in the Osaka zone while I was the zone
leader…and now he's going to be my companion in Higashi Osaka. I haven't yet had to deal with those
issues in a companion, but it will probably work out alright… I am…glad that I will be staying here
at least for another transfer… There's a lot to accomplish here, and people I love here and in
Abeno… Elder Carlile transferred away, and Elder Broeder came to take his place. I wrote the
following messages to my family over the next several weeks: New Year's Eve and Day were normal as
far as missionary work (aside from being…difficult due to losing contact with most investigators…
we're working on that)… [Brother Irie] had us over for lunch on New Year's Day to eat traditional
Japanese food… The day after the New Year was transfers, so Carlile-choro left for Nishiwaki and I
met up with Elder Broeder… working with Elder Broeder for the last few days has actually been a
really good thing. The morning after we arrived back in Higashi Osaka, he had a couple issues with
the morning schedule, so I brought it up during companionship study and didn't beat around the bush
about it… His reaction at first wasn't good… it got to the point where I told him that he needed to
think about why he was even out here on a mission, and then he opened up and I learned a lot about
him. Ever since then, there hasn't been a problem, and it's been…enjoyable working with him. It may
possibly have been the fastest friendship I've built with a companion. Meals with members are pretty
rare, but everyone had vacation for the whole week of the New Year, so we actually had a few — the
most significant being a meal with the bishop and his wife and the ward missionaries at the bishops'
home on Wednesday night! It is extremely rare for the bishop to have missionaries or anyone over to
their home because they are so busy (I don't know if it happened a single time in the previous
year)… that was a …good opportunity, and we shared a message with everyone that went really well… we
invited everyone to invite one person to come to church on the 9th of February. It's part of a big
goal we're working on as an area [elder and sisters] for church attendance. The members are on
board, too; on Sunday I was asked to share a shorter version of the same message at a meeting before
church and extend the same invitation to more members… [In answer to your question,] yes, we do have
opportunities to use the priesthood for blessings. Throughout my mission I've given a few blessings
to sister missionaries and to investigators… the other day, an elderly member requested a blessing
for her leg; it had been causing her so much pain that she couldn't walk at times. We performed the
ordinance before church, and then during sacrament meeting she got up and bore her testimony of the
power of the priesthood. ( : It's been a busy week! I did two companion exchanges with the other
areas in my district.… we have been working a lot with the Murata family… and with Masanori, a
college student who started investigating last week. Also, we received a referral from Seattle!! The
guy's nickname is Hammer [real name is Tetsuya]… he lived in Seattle for a year because he was
studying English. The missionaries there helped him learn English and taught him most of the
lessons… he was super excited to find out that we do free English classes in Japan as well as in
America. He came to church on Sunday, and we taught him for the first time… it was awesome. The
thing that was difficult for him while he was learning the Gospel in America was that he doesn't
have any kind of Christian background, but for us, that's normal! …in other news, one of the stake
presidency approached me on Sunday and asked me to speak for 10 minutes at Osaka's stake conference
next Sunday… no pressure. …the week before last…I performed two companion exchanges helping
missionaries in Abeno and Habikino, had to prepare for and conduct Friday's district meeting, and
had to give a talk at stake conference on Saturday night, in addition to normal missionary work. But
somehow everything worked out! And this week was…great, too. We had interviews on Thursday, where I
received some of the best training that I've received on my mission (maybe it always feels like
that). One of my favorite parts was when President Zinke talked about…faith. We talked about whether
our faith as missionaries is based in Christ or in outcomes, and that was…enlightening. If our faith
is based in the outcomes of our efforts, then when we work our hardest and the results aren't
apparent, our faith is injured. But if our faith is truly based in Christ, then we can always move
forward and perform cheerfully all the things that are within our power; we can bear trials without
complaint; and our faith is ideally about as unchanging as God. I tried to apply this principle to
my own mindset over the last few days, and…it is powerful! This last week, we worked as an entire
mission to achieve a…large goal for church attendance. We involved the members in it as well (which
is how missionary work should be done!), and invited as many people as we could ourselves… I spent
hours mailing and calling investigators and potential investigators, delivered hand-written
invitations and home-made banana chocolate chip bread to some potential investigators, prayed for it
every day… And we had 13 non-members at church on Sunday in Higashi Osaka. The most amazing part of
that is that 9 of them were brought by members! We ourselves brought only 2, and the sisters brought
2 as well. Hammer was one of the two we brought… we taught him a lesson during 2nd hour, and he set
a baptismal goal for the 9th of March! The other, Shin'ichi, came to church for the first time… and
that was a miracle. As far as the goal, we prayed and worked our hardest, and our prayers were
answered (we met our goal) — but not in the way we expected [in that most of the non-members that
came were brought by members rather than by us]! Quick update on the Murata family… we stuck Sister
Iwata on them, and she's helping them a lot. Looking through the recent Liahonas this morning, I
found a lot of…good talks that I'm excited to give to the Muratas and some other investigators.
There is so much power in the words of the prophets and apostles… We got transfers calls today, and
I will stay in Higashi Osaka for a 4th transfer! Which is…surprising, but I'm happy about it. I love
this area and want to get it in…better shape before I leave. Elder Broeder is staying, too. Not
[much] to update from last week… Tetsuya got sick this last week and couldn't come to church or have
a lesson, but it seems like he's getting better and should be able to meet this week… we were able
to meet with the Muratas a couple times, and we had some cool finding experiences. I'll wait until
next week to share those, though. I want to see if the people that we found will [actually] become
investigators! I believe that this is the first time in my mission that I consciously decided to not
go into detail about potential investigators whom we found and to instead wait to see if they would
actually meet with us and progress at all. I did not want to portray the finding experiences as more
than they actually were — encounters that might or might not result in a future meeting.
…this…week…we went and ate some all-you-can-eat Korean-style barbeque with a half-Korean lady [whom
I had contacted from the area book] and the sister missionaries. That was fun…in the end, everyone
was just watching me eat. …Yumiko called me up out of the blue and met up with us and became an
investigator again… she wants to attend church in Higashi Osaka next week… She had to stop attending
in Abeno a while back because she started stalking one the members there, but apparently she's been
reading the Book of Mormon a lot recently and wants to hear the lessons. She's pretty funny and
is…always doing things that are socially unacceptable, like hugging missionaries. We visited our
friend Hero, a bike shop owner nearby the church, and it was …great because a few friends and
acquaintances of his randomly showed up there while we were talking to him, and he helped us to out
by… telling them about how we are volunteer missionaries teaching about Jesus Christ for two years,
and we teach English for free, and those kinds of things, so all we had to do was just be friendly…
it was pretty fun… a few people…want to meet up with us and have us teach them English, I think one
of them wants me to marry his daughter (which the scriptures indicate may be a sign of receptiveness
to the Gospel; don't worry, my position currently reflects Ammon's), and at least two have Sundays
off from work. ( : On Sunday, we taught Tetsuya more about the Restoration and what is different
about the origin and nature of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from other churches.
We visited him a few days ago and dropped off a copy of Our Search for Happiness and a couple
brownies, which he was pretty happy about, and then we taught him at church on Sunday… he committed
to continue to read the Book of Mormon and pray (he already knows it's true, though), and he said
a…good prayer at the end of the lesson. And he expressed gratitude to us afterward for teaching him,
which was…nice to hear. It's interesting the influence that a year of living in the United States
has had on his perception of religion… Something…awesome happened this last week! One of our
investigators, Shin'ichi, has been living in poverty and trying to find a job for over 5 years. We
were finally able to persuade him to come to church on February 2 and see what kind of blessings God
has in store for him, and he came and enjoyed Sacrament meeting… and last week, he started his new
job! A new factory opened recently and called him up to see if he would work there. He was…happy and
invited us over to his apartment Sunday night to talk… up until now he has only been able to meet
with missionaries about once a month because he had to do his job hunting and report his job finding
efforts regularly to the city office (since he was getting financial support), but now that
restriction has been removed. I did lots of talking with my companion this last week… Recently, we
have been talking a lot about faith/testimonies… Elder Broeder is a good guy. I think I am learning
a lot by working with him… we've had a couple previous companions in common (Elder Mergist and Elder
Smart)… My perspective on many things began to change while I served with Elder Broeder. He was
different than any of my other companions. He was very real, and he became a good friend to me. It
was true that he had less regard for missionary rules than more straight-laced missionaries like me,
but he was willing to follow the rules because he knew that they were important to me, and I could
tell that he was sincere in his desire to share the Gospel with others. When I eventually admitted
to Elder Broeder that I had heard bad things about him and had been somewhat biased against him at
the beginning of our time together, I found out that much of what I had heard from Elder Mergist
about Elder Broeder was misleading. From Elder Broeder's perspective, any disobedience during his
two transfers as a trainee had originated from his trainer. Elder Mergist had not kept the morning
schedule, had taken advantage of his trainee's ignorance by skipping study time altogether on
preparation days (Elder Broeder did not find out until after getting a new companion that they were
actually supposed to follow a shortened study schedule on preparation days), etc., generally showing
a great willingness to ignore the rules. Elder Broeder had never spoken badly of Elder Mergist at
all to anyone, though, and he was surprised that Elder Mergist had spoken so poorly and unfairly of
him to other missionaries. Elder Broeder had a much different experience within the LDS church than
my own. He had never fit in with other members ever since he was young, and he felt that he had
often been mistreated or rejected. He felt that his priesthood leaders never cared about him, and as
he grew up, it became difficult for him to find a place for himself within the church. When he was
in his early 20s, though, his father died of cancer, and that hit Elder Broeder hard. He loved his
dad. That was the trigger that led Elder Broeder to solidify his testimony and serve a mission. And
Elder Broeder did have a testimony — one stronger than my own, I suspected. I came to trust Elder
Broeder a lot, and my thinking about certain things began to change. I realized that the church as
an institution truly was imperfect. I already knew that, of course, but I felt it for the first time
listening to Elder Broeder's story. I also began to realize that some of my mission's rules and
practices were ineffectual and did not help missionaries to accomplish the Lord's work; I began to
recognize some of my own frustrations with certain mission tools such as OYM and 2GS, which I had
obligitorily propogated as a zone leader and district leader but which I felt were too constricting
and could remove the role of the Spirit from missionary work. In short, I still desired to be an
obedient missionary and to fulfill the expectations of my leaders and subordinate missionaries, but
I started to be more honest with myself, too. To continue— On Thursday I went to Kobe for a district
leader council, and we received some…awesome training…basically about who Jesus Christ is (the idea
being that in order to more fully rely on Him as missionaries, we need to deepen and strengthen our
own understanding and testimonies of who He is)… we had to turn around and introduce the same
material from DLT at district meetings throughout the mission the next morning… It went pretty well
over here. I really like my district this transfer. Aside from that… we didn't teach a ton of
lessons last week, but Yumiko did meet with us again and come to church on Sunday. Did I tell you
that the ward mission leader got hit by a car? He was biking and got hit by a car… Brother Suzuki
[the ward mission leader] has been somewhat incapacitated [by that] for a couple weeks, so I've been
teaching the Gospel Principles class at church… which consisted only of Carmen (the sister's
investigator from Belgium) and Yumiko and a couple members yesterday. Carmen requested a priesthood
blessing of healing after church, which my companion and I did… also, it was Yumiko's birthday, so I
made more banana chocolate chip bread Saturday night and brought a nice loaf of it which made her
pretty happy, and I gave some to Carmen and the sisters, too, so everyone was happy. Tetsuya…didn't
come to church! [We are] not sure why, because he didn't answer our phone call or email [yet]. We'll
pay him a visit tonight. The people we met at the bike shop never called us! Their loss, I guess.
You know how valuable my free English is?? Maybe they got scared off because the flier that I gave
them with our phone number on it was a flier about our message of Jesus Christ and they thought we'd
try to convert them if they contacted us. Fair enough… Not too much to report as far as
investigators maybe… Tetsuya is doing well enough. Shin'ichi…got that new job, but it's at a new
factory that is working him…hard and has not given him any days off yet. So he wants to take Sundays
off but has no idea when he is even going to be able to take a day off, and he was…frustrated about
that when we met him the other night. Will you add your prayers to ours? Aside from that, it seems
that some of the members noticed that my companion and I have been getting along well recently — the
ward mission leader commented on it, and now we have a couple referrals to work with in the next
couple weeks. Interesting. Brother Suzuki is back in commission, by the way. We referred Yumiko to
the sister missionaries, and we have a new investigator that came to church on Sunday! Super nice
old man named Toratani. …We'll be visiting the Muratas again tonight. Hitoshi is the only fully
mobile member of that family… his brother is handicapped (physically and somewhat mentally) and his
mother and grandmother have lost the use of their legs and can't do anything except for lay on the
ground all day. If that sounds crazy, it is… Hitoshi himself has innumerable health issues,
including an unknown and therefore incurable skin disease that causes him significant discomfort.
His family loves the missionaries to death, and Hitoshi is so grateful when we come over… What I
have seen as I've met with the Muratas over the last week or two is the power of showing love. I
can't comprehend Hitoshi's suffering because I'm not Jesus, but when we show our love to this
family, it makes all the difference in the world to them. They're feeling the Father's love through
us… …when we lost contact with [Sakura-san], we figured it had to do with her husband coming back
from Myanmar and being opposed to religion. I wrote her a letter, Elder Carlile drew her a picture,
and we brought those and a bag of treats to their house and left them there. Still no reply… we
randomly visited in the middle of the day last week, and she was there! (She is usually gone at
work.) And she answered the door and started crying… the letter and picture had meant a lot to her
but she couldn't even say thank you because her husband wouldn't let her contact us. She wants to
continue to go to the church and learn, but that's not possible for the moment. We're working on it…

AB lesson with Peter We met with Peter for an AB (after-baptism) lesson during my exchange in Abeno
on Wednesday! He's doing…great and thinking a lot about his future right now. This week, we had more
lessons, which was good… Met with Hitoshi, Takeshi, Chon Jan, Tetsuya, and Yan… did a couple
companion exchanges and…had zone training meeting on Friday… Dear Mom, Today's email is for you!
It's a short one, sorry… recently the work has basically been slow. We are still working, and I like
my companion Elder Broeder a lot. But, investigators that progress to baptism have been pretty
elusive over the last several months, which is a bummer. We recently had to drop the Muratas…and
we've cycled through many others throughout the last few months… We are still working with Tetsuya,
though, and we're holding out hope for him. He's a…good guy and just needs to…decide that he will
act on what he already believes… I…love the Higashi Osaka ward and wish that I could do more to
strengthen it… we will keep working hard and looking for ways to improve… my favorite thing to do. ;
) Time is so short, now. I can't believe [there are only two months left]… I traveled to Kobe on
Thursday and picked up my new companion. His name is… 土屋健介. …I got my first and only Japanese
companion! They decided to have me train one of them for my final transfer. Elder Tsuchiya is from
Chiba [Prefecture], near Tokyo, and he is awesome. It feels strange to be his trainer when the only
thing that I have up on him is gaijin power (the power of being a foreigner) and experience… He is
a… good teacher already and has a strong testimony, and it has been fun starting to teach our
investigators again this week. Only one more transfer… This week was great — we didn't get to teach
as many lessons as we wanted, but we're headed in the right direction. Our English class has grown a
lot over the last couple weeks…and we started teaching three of the students! They are awesome. A
brother who recently returned from his mission in Fukuoka helped us teach Toshiya and Yoshi, and it
went well… Also, our investigator Kitatsuji just set a baptismal date for the 4th of May! We were
actually just having a lesson with him a couple hours ago, and he committed to pray and study the
scriptures daily. It feels like Elder Tsuchiya and I are starting to get into the swing of things as
a companionship… I was happy to finally have a Japanese companion for my final transfer in the
mission, and I liked Elder Tsuchiya as an individual, too. I wanted to do a good job as his trainer.
Also, because this was my final transfer, I knew that if there was anything that I wanted to improve
about my missionary work, this was the time to do it. I wanted to finish my mission well. Studying
Preach My Gospel is central to the 12 Week Training Program that I carried out with Elder Tsuchiya.
While training Elder Tsuchiya and diving into PMG, I realized for the first time that a lot of the
things we were doing in the mission were not in harmony with the principles in Preach My Gospel —
particularly Setting the Table and related teachings and practices: Preach My Gospel 's Teachings
Japan Kobe Mission's Teachings Emphasize the Restoration no matter where you serve or whom you
teach. Omit the Restoration until later in the teaching process because Japanese people are
different; use Setting the Table Teach by the Spirit, freely use your own words as prompted by the
Spirit, and do not memorize and recite the lessons. Memorize and recite Setting the Table to all
investigators so that they will feel God's love Memorize phrases and brief statements of doctrine
that are personally meaningful to you, not entire lessons. Memorize and recite the Setting the Table
lesson to all investigators. Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear
witness. You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed
by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true.
Create a spiritual oasis before you begin teaching. You do this by setting a room up in the church,
having the heater or the AC running beforehand, etc. When beginning to teach, demonstrate love for
and interest in investigators by asking relevant questions and covering key points as directed by
the Spirit. When beginning to teach, recite the Setting the Table lesson because it applies equally
to all investigators and will help them to feel God's love. Adjust your teaching according to the
promptings of the Spirit in order to meet the needs of the unique individuals and families whom you
teach. Recite the Setting the Table lesson to every investigator. Prepare, memorize, and recite 30
second statements and heart-felt statements in your lessons. I decided to begin applying principles
from PMG by learning the How to Begin Teaching points again and using those points in addition to
parts of Setting the Table rather than reciting the Setting the Table lesson in its entirety. Elder
Tsuchiya and I learned the How to Begin Teaching points together, and we started using them in our
finding activities and in our first lessons with new investigators. When we did so, I felt that the
quality of our first lessons improved dramatically. We began finding more new investigators, and our
numbers started shooting up. I would love to write you a nice long email, [but there is not enough
time because] we just taught a surprise lesson to a new person at the church… he walked in on us.
His name is Masanao! We are working…hard, and we've been finding…new people to teach recently!
Having only a month or so left, I've been able to develop fresh perspective about the work and
change things up a bit. It is so awesome to apply correct principles, follow the Spirit, and see the
results. I love my mission and our message… I felt that my companion and I were actually following
the Spirit when we taught lessons, and that was something that I had felt for a long time was
lacking in my missionary work. I began to realize more and more how off-base I had become by using
all of the tools that had been produced by the Kobe mission without studying Preach My Gospel. As I
continued to study Preach My Gospel more and more and to apply the principles that I found within
its pages, our missionary work became not only more successful (in terms of numbers) but more
enjoyable. I still believed, as I had been taught, that the Kobe mission's teachings and tools were
revelations from God for the benefit of the mission. I believed that they were being misused,
though. It was obvious that the mission as a whole had moved away from Preach My Gospel. Mission
Training Plans and other Kobe-mission-specific revelations and tools were heavily emphasized, and
Preach My Gospel was essentially ignored. If I had not been obligated to study Preach My Gospel as a
trainer, I would not have had any reason to open it. I had, of course, studied Preach My Gospel in
the same context (of the 12 week training program) when I trained Elder Carlile a few transfers
earlier. I had not taken Preach My Gospel seriously at that time, though; I was simply going through
the motions. I considered training Elder Carlile on the mission-specific revelations and tools
(Setting the Table, 30 second statements, Topic Teaching Summaries, etc.) to be more important. It
was not until after I had completed Elder Carlile's training that I became aware of what I already
knew subconsciously — that some things in the mission were not right — and when I had to study
Preach My Gospel as Elder Tsuchiya's trainer, I finally realized what was not right: no one was
studying Preach My Gospel and actively trying to apply its principles, and much of what we were
doing was not in harmony with Preach My Gospel. Initially, my applications of Preach My Gospel
principles while working with Elder Tsuchiya were an experiment. I did not know if my missionary
work would improve, although I hoped and expected that it would. The Preach My Gospel way seemed
better to me when I though about it logically; it seemed that it would bring the Spirit more into
missionary work. After I began the experiment, I knew with an absolute surety that applying the
principles of Preach My Gospel was the right thing to do. I became happier as a missionary; I felt
the Spirit more; and my numbers improved. I was a district leader, and I felt that I needed to share
my findings with my district. There was somewhat of a dilemna, though. I did not want to denounce
any of the mission's current practices, the Mission Training Plans, or any of the teachings of upper
leadership. I simply wanted for my district members to try applying principles from Preach My Gospel
because I truly believed that doing so would be of benefit to them. I wanted to be obedient both to
the Kobe mission's teachings and to Preach My Gospel, and I wanted for my district members to be
able to do the same. In district meeting, I pulled out Preach My Gospel and shared a message about
the importance of using Preach My Gospel in addition to the Mission Training Plans. My message to my
district members was essentially that studying and applying principles from Preach My Gospel in
addition to the Mission Training Plans — rather than the Mission Training Plans alone — would bring
us blessings in our missionary work and would strengthen our foundations as missionaries. I shared
some insights about how we could improve our study habits to incorporate Preach My Gospel, and I
bore heart-felt testimony. My district members really liked that district meeting; I think that it
was a spiritual experience for all of us, and for some of my district members (if not most of them),
it was the first time that Preach My Gospel had been pulled out in a district meeting. During an
exchange with the Abeno2 elders following that district meeting, we had a great finding experience
in which we spoke with a man on the street, walked him to the church, and taught him an excellent
first lesson using the How to Begin Teaching points rather than reciting the Setting the Table
script. We showed a genuine interest in him; utilized How to Begin Teaching points in addition to
some bits and pieces from the Setting the Table Lesson; and shared a scripture with him according to
what we felt his needs were. He felt our love for him, was intrigued by the lesson, met with the
Abeno2 elders again the next day, and quickly became a progressing investigator. My numbers in
Higashi Osaka continued to shoot upward; we gained several new investigators throughout the week,
and our progressing investigators number increased significantly as well. During the week, I
received a phone call from one of the assistants. We talked, and it turned out that he had called
because he had heard something about me not using the Setting the Table lesson. He was concerned and
wanted to make sure that we were on the same page. I was glad for the chance to talk with him. I
told him that I felt that most missionaries in the mission were not using Preach My Gospel, that
there were problems with the way that some mission tools (including Setting the Table) were being
used, and that Preach My Gospel was helping me to improve my missionary work. He later sent me a
follow-up message in which he encouraged me to not be frustrated with the mission and said that the
Kobe mission's Mission Training Plans truly were revelation from God to us through the mission
president. I replied with the following message: I think that missionaries will develop better
skills, testimonies, foundations, and independence as they study and apply PMG in addition to MTPs.
After all, PMG is the tool that is intended to guide missionary work throughout the whole world, and
it is the source for many doctrines in MTPs. As great as MTPs are, they are not sufficient alone. I
do not think that missionaries will have a very solid foundation if they do not study PMG thoroughly
in addition to utilizing MTPs. I feel this way largely because of my own situation. I am glad that
the Spirit and revelation are emphasized in the mission… From my perspective, young missionaries
cannot use [Setting the Table]. It takes so much time for them to memorize it. For many [foreign]
missionaries, even if they do memorize it, they do not know the meaning of the words that they are
saying. I think that that is an unacceptable way to teach. … Carter-choro, right now I am the
happiest and the most energetic that I have been in a long time as a missionary. I realize that
because of some of the things that I said, you may have felt that I was frustrated. I promise that I
am not frustrated or bitter! Just [feel strongly about these things]. I had a lot of things I wanted
to talk to you about. (^^) I am happy with my mission, too. It is priceless to me. I do wish that I
had not wasted part of the second half of it by not giving my all to the work, but that is a
personal regret not directed toward anyone else. I can forgive myself for that because I am fixing
it now! The next district meeting was the last district meeting of the transfer — and my final
district meeting, since it was my final transfer. I was bolder this time. I basically read from
Preach My Gospel and from the scriptures with my district for the whole two hours. We read all of
the sections of Preach My Gospel that teach principles that I knew the mission as a whole was not
following, and we also read supporting scriptures and discussed the meaning of the things we read.
It was a powerful district meeting. I could tell that the elders were really into it and that it was
a spiritual experience for them. I did not solicit any feedback, but afterward, the elders told me
that they had felt the Spirit, that it had been the most inspiring district meeting they had ever
been to, etc. I could tell that a couple of the sisters felt uncomfortable during my district
meeting, though, and it wasn't hard to guess why. They were hearing things that were different than
what they had been taught throughout their entire missions up that point. I did not have a chance to
talk with any of them personally after district meeting because we split up to eat lunch before
returning to our respective areas. After eating a yakiniku lunch with the elders, I began a
companion exchange with the Habikino elders and traveled to Habikino with Elder Baldwin. At 10:30
p.m. that night, my phone started ringing. It was President Zinke. I answered the phone, knowing
that the situation must be serious if my mission president was calling me at lights-out time, and I
proceeded to receive a verbal beat-down like no other I had ever heard of during my mission. I
cannot remember how long it lasted, but I remember that it was not pleasant. My mission president
was angry and was speaking in a raised voice. He treated me as if I had done something horrible and
was a disgusting, disgraceful person. He accused me of rebellion and of stabbing him in the back. I
could hardly get in a word; nothing that I had to say mattered to him at that point. He threatened
to send me home early, and he told me over the phone that I was immediately released as district
leader and was to return to my own area first thing the next morning because he did not want me to
be near other missionaries. Elder Baldwin, meanwhile, was on the futon next to mine sitting with
eyes wide and jaw dropped. I do not know if he could hear what President Zinke was saying, but he
certainly got the general idea. After the phone call ended, I remember him saying things to the
effect of, Why is this happening, and You didn't do anything wrong, and I don't get it. He seemed
pretty amazed — possibly in shock, as I was. My mission president's words about sending me home
early kept going through my mind. Mormons know what it means to be sent home early from a mission.
Initially, it felt like a death sentence looming over me, and I was frightened. After a few minutes,
though, I was able to settle my nerves and think about the situation more rationally. For me to be
sent home early would be too wrong; it could not be justified. There had obviously been a
misunderstanding. The next morning, we met up with our companions at the train station and went back
to our own areas. Because I had been released as district leader, I did not call any of my district
members throughout the week. I had expected President Zinke to call again, but he never did, so I
ended up not having any contact with anyone except for the zone leaders and my companion for the
next week. My zone leaders just seemed sorry about the whole situation. I do not know what they were
told by President Zinke or by the assistants, but they knew me to some extent. I had been a zone
leader to both of them when they were younger missionaries, and they respected me. They also seemed
not to be too ecstatic about having to take over my district leader responsibilities (including
direct follow-up with 12 missionaries) on top of their own responsibilities. Surprisingly, my
companion and I were able to work well that week. I felt that there were forces conspiring against
me and that I could not go wrong by continuing to work as hard as I could and follow Preach My
Gospel principles as best as I knew how. Elder Tsuchiya and I talked with tons of people that week,
and we taught a good number of lessons. I felt more purposeful and sincere than ever, and I also
felt that I was exercising faith in a way that I never had before — I was trying to do the right
thing in spite of looming opposition. I was able to buckle down and continue to work, so that week's
missionary work was enjoyable and satisfying in spite of my uncertainty about what President Zinke
might be thinking or what his plans for me might be. At the end of the week (by which I mean on
Preparation Day), I wrote the following to my family: This has been the most insane week of my
mission. I will have to wait to tell you about it until after I get home because…the story contains
sensitive information… …last Friday was my final district meeting… Afterward, [everyone] except for
the four sister missionaries [since our district was too large to be gathered publicly] went to eat
lunch at an all-you-can-eat yakiniku (meat) restaurant.

After which, I began a companion exchange with the Habikino elders and worked with Elder Baldwin…for
a day in Habikino.

We taught lots of lessons this week in Higashi Osaka, and we have lots of progressing investigators
now! Missionary work has never been so awesome… The [man] we taught last week, Masanao, met us again
this morning… we taught him the Plan of Salvation, which…spiked his interest, and he's going to meet
us again tomorrow! Masanao is already applying the teachings of Jesus Christ on a whole different
level than most; the whole purpose of his life is to help others, and he donates most of his income
to charity. Tomorrow, we plan to teach him the doctrine of Christ out of 2 Nephi 31. The next week
happened to be interviews, so at that time I was able to finally see and speak with President Zinke
face to face. I was able to see everyone else from my district, too, since the whole zone was
gathered in Osaka. Two of the sisters seemed to be avoiding eye contact with me, so I figured that
my assumption was correct that one or more of them had probably been involved in what happened after
the district meeting. In any case, I knew where I stood with the elders — I was glad to see them,
and they were glad to see me. When President Zinke arrived, he treated me just like all of the other
missionaries: he gave me a handshake and a bright smile. I felt a little relieved because he at
least didn't seem to be holding a grudge about anything. The meeting was opened, and the assistants
did trainings while President Zinke interviewed the missionaries. When it was my turn to be
interviewed, I entered the interview room with slight apprehension, but again, President Zinke
greeted me normally. We started talking, and I was glad at first that things seemed to be going so
smoothly, but I gradually became somewhat confused as our conversation continued. He said something
to the effect of, I'm not going to send you home — I love you, Fred-choro, in an almost sheepish
way, so he was clearly aware that that was something that would have been on my mind. I let him know
that I felt there had been a misunderstanding, and I said something to the effect of, I wish that I
had been able to talk to you when you called me that night. President Zinke didn't say anything to
the contrary on that point, but he proceeded to tell me what he had heard about the district
meeting. He said that one of the sisters was very disturbed afterward and had called him directly,
and that her descriptions of my district meeting had included the words, raising a rebellion, and
two hours of apostasy. I was astounded. I told him that I had never had any intention at all of
rebelling against him, that I had no spirit of rebellion about me, and that during the district
meeting we had only read straight from Preach My Gospel and from the scriptures. All that President
Zinke said regarding the actual content of my district meeting, though, was that that isn't the way
we operate within the church and that it was not right for a priesthood leader to teach something
contrary to the teachings of higher leadership. President Zinke also told me that everyone in my
district had said that it was a strange, weird meeting, and that no one had felt the Spirit. Those
words hit me hard. I knew that the district meeting had been a spiritual experience for the elders
of my district. Several of them had explicitly told me so afterward, the others had voiced consent,
and I could tell that they meant it. I told President Zinke as much, and he replied that he had
spoken with all of my district members, that they had told him otherwise, and that they must have
not told the truth to me because of our relationship as peers. Although I was confident that this
was not the case, I didn't feel that it would be a good idea to press the issue. During the
interview, President Zinke briefly reproved me for teaching missionaries not to use Setting the
Table. (In my district meeting, I had encouraged my district members to apply principles of Preach
My Gospel by utilizing pieces of Setting the Table as directed by the Spirit rather than reciting
the whole thing word for word from beginning to end.) He asked me why I was trying to sabotage
Setting the Table when he had already given me permission as an individual to not use it. At first,
I did not know what he meant by that, but then I realized that the only thing that he could be
referring was something that he had said at a Trainer Trainee Training Meeting at mission
headquarters a month or two earlier. I had asked him in front of all of the other trainers and
trainees whether or not it would be acceptable to tweak some of the wording and grammatical
constructions of Setting the Table in order to speak more naturally (since written and spoken
Japanese are stylistically different), and he had replied in front of everyone that it would be fine
for Fred-choro to do that since his Japanese is so good but that everyone else should use it as is
(word for word). I appreciated the compliment and was glad at the time that I, at least, was not
required to recite the awkward Japanese translation of President Zinke's Setting the Table script
word for word, but President Zinke absolutely never gave me permission to change the content of the
Setting the Table lesson or to not use it. When President Zinke indicated during my interview that
he had already given me permission as an individual to not use Setting the Table, he was
manipulatively — and in a relatively nonabrasive way — making me out as the bad guy who had
needlessly caused a ruckus. I had neither maliciously nor needlessly caused a ruckus, though:

- I did not have special permission to not use Setting the Table. It would not have even made
  logical or ethical sense for Fred-choro (me) and his companion to be the only ones in the mission
  with permission to not use Setting the Table as a first lesson.
- As a leader, I had many opportunities to observe other missionaries using Setting the Table
  (during training meetings, companion exchanges, etc.). It was consistently bad. Many missionaries
  did not understand all of the grammar and vocabulary included in the script and could only give
  poor, choppy, difficult-to-understand recitations even after spending much time to memorize the
  script. Even missionaries with decent Japanese could not turn the Setting the Table lesson into
  something more than what it was — a recitation. I wanted for all missionaries to teach quality
  lessons by the Spirit and according to the needs of their investigators; even if I were an
  exception to the Setting the Table rule, it would not have been right for me to ignore the way
  that Setting the Table was being used by other missionaries. Although some of the things that
  President Zinke said during my interview were troubling, he was pleasant. He made me feel that I
  was accepted back into his good graces, even if we were not exactly on the same page. Even after
  bringing up Setting the Table, President Zinke did not speak to me at all about any of the
  principles that I had taught in my district meeting, so in that sense, the content of our
  interview was fairly insubstantial. I left my interview still convinced that everything that had
  been taught in my district meeting was true and right; it had been straight out of Preach My
  Gospel, after all, and President Zinke evidently had not felt any need to speak with me about
  anything that we had read from Preach My Gospel. I felt that because the content of my district
  meeting certainly had been good, my real error could only have been carelessness that had resulted
  in miscommunications. President Zinke's words about my district members not feeling the spirit and
  having a strange, wrong feeling about the district meeting continued to gnaw at me, though; he had
  lied to me, and we both knew it. My relationship with the elders in my district was one of trust,
  not one of facades. Not only did they have no reason to lie to me about having felt the Spirit or
  having been inspired, I had been there with them at my district meeting and had observed
  first-hand their reactions to the material that had been presented out of Preach My Gospel and out
  of the scriptures. I knew that the district meeting had been a spiritually inspiring experience
  for them as well as for myself — but something was wrong: President Zinke was claiming otherwise
  and was citing my district members as sources. He must have felt that by making the claim that no
  one had felt the Spirit in my district meeting, he could persuade me that what had been taught in
  my district meeting was wrong. After my interview, when I had the chance to speak with some of the
  elders again, they confirmed to me both that they had felt the Spirit at my district meeting and
  that they had never said otherwise to President Zinke or to anyone else. Elder Baldwin added that
  he was confused because even though he knew that he had felt the Spirit at my district meeting,
  President Zinke and others (the sister training leaders who shared his area) had told him that he
  had not felt the Spirit. To be clear, Elder Baldwin was not confused about what he had felt during
  the district meeting; what he was confused about was that his leaders were trying to deny his
  spiritual experience. I knew at that point that President Zinke had blatantly lied to me during my
  interview, but I chose not to escalate things by calling him out. My understanding of things was
  that as missionaries, we were expected to be obedient both to Preach My Gospel and to our mission
  president. I knew from my studies of Preach My Gospel that the First Presidency expected Preach My
  Gospel to be used in personal study, companion study, and district and zone meetings, and that
  mission presidents did not have authority to contradict Preach My Gospel any more than they had
  authority to contradict the canonized scriptures of the church. (Mission presidents can,
  incidentally, adjust missionary standards and rules outlined in the Missionary Handbook ; Preach
  My Gospel is different.) With that understanding, I wanted for Preach My Gospel and President
  Zinke to be compatible in some way. I continued to try to find ways to reconcile the two in my
  mind — to find ways to do the right thing by being obedient to President Zinke while also being
  obedient and true to Preach My Gospel. I knew subconsciously that the two likely could not be
  compatible, but I continued to try to reconcile the two because I also knew that things would not
  work out for me if Preach My Gospel and President Zinke were incompatible. I did not want to rebel
  against my mission president. At the end of my interview, President Zinke had told me that he
  wanted me to apologize to all of my district members. He did not specify what I needed to
  apologize for, and for obvious reasons it would not have been possible for me to apologize for the
  content of the district meeting (which consisted only of Preach My Gospel and the scriptures), so
  I decided to apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred and reaffirm to everyone
  that I supported President Zinke and was in no way encouraging them to rebel against him but only
  to find appropriate ways to apply both his teachings and the teachings in Preach My Gospel
  together. I started by calling the Higashi Osaka sisters. I first apologized for any
  misunderstandings — for anything that I may have carelessly miscommunicated at district meeting
  that might have led them to believe that I opposed President Zinke. I also told them that one of
  the sisters had apparently used the words raising a rebellion and two hours of apostasy during a
  phone call with President Zinke, and that had led to further misunderstandings. (Honestly, I may
  have been indirectly fishing for who had been the one to speak with President Zinke, but that did
  not really matter to me; more than that, it hurt me to know that one of the sisters had gone so
  far as to say something like that, and I wanted the sister — whoever she was — to be aware that
  her rash words had caused unnecessary damage.) I repeated the same process with the Habikino
  sisters. Both companionships accepted my apology. One of the Higashi Osaka sisters said (if I
  remember correctly) that she was genuinely sorry if I had been hurt by whatever had been said to
  President Zinke but that she honestly felt that what I had taught in district meeting had been
  totally out of harmony with President Zinke's teachings; the other sister said that she didn't
  think that I should try to find out who had been the one to say the words. I think that the former
  sister was entirely sincere, both in being sorry about the effect that the words had on my
  feelings and about feeling that my district meeting's content and President Zinke's teachings were
  incompatible. After getting off the phone, I felt that my apology for miscommunications may have
  come across as an apology for the content of the district meeting as a whole. That was
  unacceptable to me; I decided to follow up by sending a clarifying email. I wrote a lengthy email
  and sent it out to my whole district (except for the zone leaders, who had not been at my district
  meeting). In the email, I again apologized for any misunderstandings that may have occurred, I
  reaffirmed to everyone that I supported President Zinke and had no intention of rebelling against
  him, and I encouraged them to find appropriate ways to apply his teachings and the teachings in
  Preach My Gospel that had been discussed in district meeting. That night, I got a phone call from
  President Zinke. It was as bad as the first time, if not worse. He told me that he could not
  believe that I was so sure that I knew better than him — so sure that I had a better way. I tried
  to tell him otherwise, but he insisted vigorously that I thought that I knew better than him. He
  insulted and belittled me, saying that I apparently did not have anything better to do with my
  time than write emails and cause trouble and that my numbers had not been any good for a long
  time. These and other abusive words did not sting as much as they would have if they had been
  true; they were not:
- I had skipped a meal in order to write out the email that I sent to my district (so that it woud
  not cut into our time for missionary work); and
- Although it was true that for the last several transfers my numbers had not been especially
  impressive on average, my numbers had actually increased dramatically over the last few weeks
  precisely as I had started trying to apply Preach My Gospel principles, to the point that our
  numbers for progressing and new investigators exceeded the Standards of Excellence (which, as I
  have mentioned before, were notoriously difficult to achieve). President Zinke told me in a
  disgusted tone of voice that if he had his way, I would be on a plane home the next day, and that
  the only reason that woud not happen was that my dad would be flying to Japan to pick me up in
  little more than a week. He forbade me from attending the zone conference that would be held a
  couple days later (which would be my last chance to see all of the missionaries in my district and
  zone before returning home), saying that he would have the zone leaders cancel the meeting and
  send everyone back to their areas if I showed up (as if I would have considered attending after he
  had explicitly told me not to go). He forbade me from having any further electronic contact with
  other missionaries. President Zinke had made his position clear enough at that point. I had tried
  so hard up to that point to make it possible for Preach My Gospel and President Zinke to be
  compatible, even if it seemed that they probably could not be, but President Zinke hated the email
  that I had sent. It seemed that he hated me for sending it, too. I knew at that point that he had
  absolutely no interest either in being compatible with Preach My Gospel or in communicating and
  reasoning with me. To my family, I wrote, I know you may have been waiting for a big final email,
  but there's nothing I can tell you now that woud not be better told in person next week. For now,
  I just want to let you know that I love the people that I have worked with here, I've learned so
  much, and I don't have any regrets.

I continued to work. I lost much of the fire that had driven me for the last several weeks, but I
did try to meet with as many investigators and members as I could throughout my last week. The
members in Higashi Osaka were very kind to me throughout a difficult portion of my mission. I loved
them, and I still love them. Brother Irie and the Watanabes and Imanishis especially made me feel
loved and accepted, and I consider Brother Irie to be a close, trusted friend even now. After what
happened with my mission president, I surprised myself by shedding a few tears at Brother Irie's
place even though I generally am not a crier. In part because I felt that I had received so much
from the Higashi Osaka ward, I was somewhat disappointed to leave the area without giving the ward a
baptism, but I was glad for the relationships that I had established there among the members and
investigators. My last evening in Higashi Osaka, I ate all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque with three of
our English students, two of whom were progressing investigators at the time. Then I traveled to
Abeno to spend the night there in preparation for my departure (as I had been instructed).

Departing for Kobe mission headquarters The next morning, I was off to mission headquarters. I was
able to spend most of that day in Kobe with the other returning missionaries, and in the evening, I
had my final interview with President Zinke. I knew that President Zinke probably hated me, but it
was over for me anyway; I accepted things as they were. When it was time for my interview, I went
into his office, and he started out normally. He seemed friendly, and I was respectful. There was an
elephant in the room, of course, but I certainly did not want to be the one to mention it, so I just
let him carry out the interview like normal. President Zinke spoke with me about marriage, giving me
the expected advice to find a spouse quickly, and he spoke with me about my career as well, advising
me to select medicine over business. After finishing with the required stuff, he started to heat up
fairly quickly; I tried to avoid provoking him while being honest in response to his questions and
accusations. It seemed to be a sort of stalemate: I refused to escalate things by becoming angry,
but I calmly and repeatedly refuted his accusations. At the end of the interview, I asked my mission
president for a temple recommend worthiness interview so that I would be able to go to the temple
with my parents upon my return to America. He refused, saying that he did not think that he would be
able to give me a recommend because I did not sustain my priesthood leaders. I was surprised — that
was not a bump that I had foreseen — and I responded that I did sustain my priesthood leaders. I
understood the word sustain to mean support and uphold, and although I knew very well at that point
that President Zinke was not a perfect man, I still sustained him in his calling as my mission
president. I asked again for the worthiness interview. President Zinke insisted that I did not
sustain him; he told me that I was on a very slippery path that could very well lead to apostasy. I
told him again that I did sustain him and all of my priesthood leaders, and in a reasonable tone I
added something to the effect that he could not answer the worthiness questions for me. He had a
somewhat strong reaction to that, responding heatedly, I am a judge in Israel! I remained calm, and
I asked again for a worthiness interview. He seemed to become flustered, and he ended up giving me
the worthiness interview. When I answered all of the worthiness questions correctly, President Zinke
told me that he would have to think about whether or not to give me a recommend because he still
felt that I did not sustain my local leaders. I let him know that I hoped that he would decide to
give me a temple recommend but that I would accept the situation if he chose not to—that I was not
scared, because I knew that everything would work out in the end. It would be inconvenient for me,
but I could simply speak with other priesthood leaders after leaving the mission. That evening, when
I was in his home with the other returning missionaries, he took me aside and told me that he had
decided to give me the recommend. That concludes my experience as a missionary in the Japan Kobe
mission. My dad arrived the next day, I enjoyed several days with him in Japan, and then we flew
back to America. I met my mom, and the three of us went to the temple in Salt Lake City. A couple
days later back home in Texas, I was released from my calling as a missionary.

Post-Mission: Reflections & Research: 21~

My end-of-mission experiences with my mission president did not define my mission as a whole.
Throughout my two years as a missionary, I had so many special experiences; I met people whom I will
never forget; and I learned many valuable life lessons by living with a companion 24/7, thinking
daily about the things that matter most in life, interacting with many different kinds of people,
etc. For these reasons and more, it would not be possible for me to regret or feel badly about my
mission even if more difficult things had happened. Although my end-of-mission experiences with my
mission president were not pleasant, I also learned valuable lessons from those experiences. After I
returned to my home, I spent a great deal of time reviewing and analyzing all of my experiences. As
I did so, and as I began to ponder about things that I had never pondered about before, I had
several significant realizations. I realized not only that priesthood leaders cannot be expected to
be perfect but also that the things that they teach are not always true. I had already known this to
some extent, of course, because it is widely — if perhaps superficially — recognized within the
church; the church acknowledges that its members are not perfect and that even prophets and apostles
make mistakes. During my mission, though, I had for the first time personally gone through painful
experiences relating to those imperfections. My trust in the priesthood leadership of the church
began to crumble as I considered the implications of my mission president's actions:

- My mission president, who was practically worshipped by the missionaries within the Japan Kobe
  mission, had given us false revelations; he had portrayed his own ideas as revelations directly
  from God to which we must be obedient in order to show our faith in Christ.
- Using mission-wide numerical goals in inappropriate ways in addition to teaching us his
  revelations, my mission president had been manipulative in pushing forward his objectives for the
  mission's numerical success.
- My mission president had personally lied to me multiple times in an attempt to control me (i.e.,
  in order to manipulate my behavior). I could understand why my mission president would have lied
  to me, and even why he would have been verbally abusive toward me: he considered me a threat to
  his authority and to the direction in which he was trying to take the Kobe mission, and he wanted
  me to be silent. I can understand why he may have felt threatened, but his behavior was in any
  case unjustifiable. A few verses from D&C 121 come to mind:
- 41 No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by
  persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;
- 42 By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and
  without guile—
- 43 Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth
  afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his
  enemy;
- 44 That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death. My mission
  president never tried to maintain his power or influence by persuading me; he never attempted even
  once to reason with me about why Preach My Gospel was wrong or why its principles did not apply to
  us in the Japan Kobe Mission, even though I would gladly have been reasoned with. My mission
  president was not long-suffering, gentle, or meek, and I did not feel love from him; I felt that
  he wanted me to disappear. If I had been wrong, he should have employed kindness and pure
  knowledge, but instead he made hypocritical accusations and attempted to beguile me. My mission
  president reproved me with sharpness, but not in a way that indicated that he had been moved upon
  by the Holy Ghost to do so; I wondered if he hated me, and I certainly did not feel that he loved
  me and wanted the best for me. I felt that my mission president esteemed me to be his enemy even
  though I did not esteem him to be mine. I did not want to have a bad relationship with my mission
  president; I wanted him to be a father figure toward me. I wanted his love and approval. Even more
  than that, though, I genuinely wanted to do the right thing. If I had thought that I might be
  wrong by trying to apply Preach My Gospel principles rather than continuing to rely solely on the
  Kobe-produced tools, I would have stopped using Preach My Gospel. I was more than willing to talk
  with President Zinke and to be persuaded if I was wrong, but he did not want to communicate with
  me. There was no justification for his behavior, which brings me to the part of his behavior that
  I could not understand: how could he dare to teach his own ideas as revelations from God? How
  could he dare to be so manipulative and dishonest toward the missionaries over whom he presided?
  What exactly were his motives? What concerned me the most as I considered the implications of my
  experiences was the possibility that there might be other priesthood leaders within the church
  (aside from my mission president) who were similarly dishonest or manipulative. What if, for
  example, the prophet and apostles taught things that were not true? What if they portrayed their
  own thoughts and ideas as revelations from God? That would be troubling. Members of the church
  accept priesthood leaders — particularly General Authorities and other high priesthood leaders —
  as instruments of the Lord, capable of directly receiving revelation from God pertaining not only
  to themselves but also to any and all of those under their stewardship. Do priesthood leaders
  truly share God's word and will with those under their stewardship, though, or do they simply
  share their own ideas with good intentions (at best) or hand down false revelations designed to
  manipulate their followers' behavior as they see fit (at worst)? Throughout my mission, I had
  observed many missionaries abusing positions of priesthood authority and/or teaching falsehoods
  from positions of priesthood authority:
- My trainer seemed to want me to follow him blindly because he was in a position of leadership over
  me. He was upset that I was in some ways a challenge to his position of superiority (because I
  learned Japanese quickly and recognized that he should not be considered an absolute authority on
  missionary work).
- One of my zone leader companions taught a zone member that it was necessary to be irrational (by
  recording impossible numerical weekly goals for baptisms in the absence of a corresponding number
  of investigators) in order to display faith.
- One particularly charismatic and inspiring AP during the time that I was a zone leader was,
  unbeknownst to most of the mission, a prideful and disobedient missionary who had falsified his
  numbers for multiple transfers in order to be selected as an AP. After becoming an AP, he assisted
  in the creation of many manipulative mission-wide goals and trainings that focused on faith and
  miraculous numerical success, and he was well-loved by my mission president because of his
  charisma (and butt-kissing; excuse my language).
- One of my zone leader companions was a lazy and disobedient missionary but aspired to become an AP
  and lead all the other missionaries in the mission. He frequently lied and stretched the truth to
  the point of breaking in order to glorify himself to other missionaries; spoke badly of his
  companions in order to raise himself higher or draw attention away from his own shortcomings; and
  was vocal about the power of faith while consistently failing to produce any legitimate evidence
  of the validity of his words.
- My mission president, as I have discussed, taught his own ideas as revelations from God and
  dishonestly manipulated his missionaries. His missionaries were brainwashed from the beginning of
  their missions into believing him to essentially be the mission's personal prophet. He was
  charismatic and well-loved, but his missionaries' image of him differed significantly from the
  reality that I was forced to come to terms with. The significance of my observations about this
  set of missionaries and about my mission president is that they caused me for the first time to
  actually question some of the assumptions that I had made throughout my life regarding the LDS
  church and its teachings. It was clear that some of the missionaries who were the most vocal about
  their convictions and faith were also manipulative and dishonest; I began to wonder whether or not
  I truly shared all of the same convictions they espoused. I recognized that it was possible that
  my mission president was not the only priesthood leader of the church who received and taught
  revelations that were not truly from God, who was arrogant in believing in the superiority of his
  own opinions to the point that he was willing to espouse his opinions as doctrine (or something
  similar to doctrine — something to be believed and followed in order to show faith), and who was
  willing to lie to protect his position and his followers' blind belief in his words. I wondered if
  it was possible that the church and its leaders might not be everything that I had always believed
  them to be. Although I continued to hold to my faith, I realized that my spiritual experiences
  within the church could neither answer nor dismiss my questions and concerns. Over the next few
  months, I carefully sorted through my feelings, experiences, and thoughts; I read the scriptures;
  I prayed; I spoke with other members (including several returned missionaries and a couple
  bishops) of their experiences within the church; and I carefully, thoroughly researched the
  church: its teachings and its history from the beginning through modernity. I was astounded by
  what I found during my research. I learned for the first time that many of the church's teachings
  about Joseph Smith, church history, the Book of Mormon, the Book of Abraham, polygamy and
  polyandry, the Holy Ghost, etc., which I had accepted as truth throughout my entire life, are very
  problematic. I also found that I am not alone in recognizing the problems; many LDS scholars
  recognize that the church's teachings about these issues are problematic. Some feel that the
  church is gradually moving in the direction of greater transparency, but nevertheless, the
  church's most recent (2013~) attempts to explain these controversial issues (e.g., the essays
  published under Gospel Topics on lds.org) continue to mislead church members by using incomplete
  information, questionable sources, and logical fallacies (circular reasoning, appeals to
  ignorance, etc.). My LDS family and friends were not eager to investigate the issues that I
  uncovered during my research. However, they recognized and accepted my sincerity in searching for
  and living according to truth, and I also fully understood their difficulty in thinking or
  investigating outside of church-approved boundaries. I elected not to push my research findings
  and my new perspectives upon them. Instead, I elected to complete my degree at BYU while slowly
  preparing (through JFred.info) to share my research findings and experiences in due course not
  only with my immediate family but with all open-hearted and open-minded Latter-day Saints. I began
  to build JFred.info. Nearly two years have passed since then, and I have cumulatively spent
  hundreds of hours in careful, thorough research of the issues addressed on this website in order
  to ensure that I am not misled and that I never, ever teach falsehoods as truths to others.

My relationship with the LDS church has not been comfortable since I learned of the falsehoods that
have been propogated within the church. However, I do not consider myself to be "anti-Mormon." My
loyalty is simply to the truth, and I have empathy for my brothers and sisters both inside and
outside of the LDS church. I hope that my sharing of my experiences prior to, during, and after my
LDS mission is of benefit to others within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. — Jacob

1. No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the
   gospel of Jesus Christ. The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the Restoration to a
   world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus Christ (Statement on Missionary Work, First
   Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you study the doctrines in the missionary lessons, you will
   come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about
   the plan of salvation, which is centered on Christ's Atonement and fulfilled by living the first
   principles and ordinances of the gospel. Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands
   the following: God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child
   of God and a member of God's family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer.
   Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing
   His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted
   it changed gospel doctrines and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy. Our Father in
   Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. He performed miracles and taught His gospel.
   He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected. Beginning with the First Vision, God has again
   reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood
   authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of
   Mormon is convincing evidence of this Restoration. As you help investigators see the pattern of
   apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day
   Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of
   salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help
   people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church.
   Rather, it is a restoration of the fulness of [the] gospel (D&C 1:23), the same as was revealed
   and taught from the beginning. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is
   convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been
   restored. It is the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this
   message. Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is
   our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that
   families can live together forever in God's presence through Christ's Atonement by obeying the
   laws and ordinances of the gospel. The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His
   children. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to
   read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to
   accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God. Trust the remarkable promise in Moroni 10:3–5.
   Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, understand it, and ask God sincerely whether
   it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has
   restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation.

   Scripture Study

   As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The
   First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: Our purpose is to teach the
   message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the
   missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but
   these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own
   words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the
   heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is
   inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own
   conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings (Statement
   on Missionary Work, First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002). As you and your companion study these
   lessons and prepare to teach, keep firmly in mind these instructions… Unless directed by the
   Spirit, for each of the first three lessons, you should give the full content in the order in
   which they are written. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be
   taught as lessons of their own.

   The Role of Memorization

   Memorize scriptures to use in your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal
   points in each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language should focus
   their language study on preparing to teach the missionary lessons. They should memorize
   vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the
   lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons.
   Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness. You do this by teaching
   and testifying of the message of the Restoration. Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify
   that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true. Neither take ye thought
   beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it
   shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man (D&C 84:85).
   The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: Our purpose is to teach the
   message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the
   missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these
   should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words
   as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in
   his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to
   do, according to the interest and needs of the investigator. Speaking out of his own conviction
   and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings (Statement on
   Missionary Work, First Presidency letter, 11 Dec. 2002).

   How to Begin Teaching

   The first few moments with investigators are very important. Investigators must learn to trust
   you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to
   help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For
   example, ask, What role has religion played in your life? Do not, however, ask personal questions
   that would make them uncomfortable. Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in
   the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the
   Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered. Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson
   in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the
   Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that
   they can feel the truth of what you will teach. Demonstrate sincere interest and love for the
   investigators and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see Moroni 7:43–48). As guided by
   the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following to your investigators: Because God is
   our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers
   and sisters. Each person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what your needs
   or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the gospel—will help you. Our message will
   enable you to improve the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and
   challenges that we all face in life. Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great
   value and importance. We all make mistakes in life, and these mistakes create feelings of guilt
   and shame. These feelings cannot be relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be
   fully healed through the Atonement of Christ. Our message cannot be learned all at once.
   Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, experience, and keeping God's
   commandments. We have weaknesses, as everyone does. We may not speak the language very well or be
   able to answer every question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share what
   we know. We know that our message is true. We will be guides so that you can learn the truth of
   our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept and act on the message. Therefore, you
   should feel free to ask questions. As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face
   challenges, but God will help you. As you accept our message, you will learn how to make
   covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in
   closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be
   baptized by proper authority (see John 3:5). Before teaching the doctrines in a lesson, consider
   giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have
   personal relevance for them… …

   Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs

   Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their
   interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their
   circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and
   live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the
   Spirit. You may alter the order of the lessons as you are inspired to adapt to the investigators'
   interests and needs. You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and
   occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows
   His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of
